dolore corporis te fuisse et animo valuisse, cum ea quae
sine causa mirantur alii neglexeris, modo ut tibi con-
stiterit fructus oti tui, quo quidem tibi perfrui mirifice
licuit, cum esses in ista amoenitate paene solus relictus
· · Neque tamen dubito quin tu in illo cubiculo tuo, ex quo
tibi Stabianum perforasti et patefecisti sinum, per eos

manent theatre constructed in

in front of their houses, that they
may obtain an unobstructeff. view

Rome, and its opening was cele-
brated by gorgeous pageants and
by combats between men and wild
beasts, in which, according to
Pliny, 20 elephants and 500 lions
were killed. The distaste which
Cicero shows for the vulgar dis-
play, and the pity which the slaugh-
ter of the unfortunate beasts ex-
cited in him, honorably distinguish
him from his contemporaries.
These particular venatebnes were so
bloodthirsty that even the Roman
populace was moved to pity when
the elephante, seeing their escape
cut off, seemed to beg for mercy:
amissa fugae spe, mirericordiam
vulgi inenarrabili habitu quaeren-
tes supplicavere, quadam sese la-
mentatione complorantes, tanta pa

asstabianum . . . sinum: the
ltalians of the present day who
have villas on the lakes or sea·
shore, often cut down the trees

across the water; so Marius wenti
seem to. have cut the trees dona
in a line through his Stabian e- =
tate (lit. ‘he hored through ³) to
the shore, and thus brought the 1
bay into view—lectiunculis, by l
reading a bit kere and a bit there. ξ
mimos: the mimus, which was ,
introduced into Rome from Taren-
tum in the third century 1³.c., was
at the outset a character presenta-
tion by dancers, but, in the sec-
ond century probably, dialogue
and songs were introduced. Facial ,
expression always played anim· ἵ
portant partin it, so that the per· ,
formers did not wear masks. In
Cicero’s time mimi were put on
the stage only as afterpieces (cf.
Ep. LXI. 7). The degraded taste
of imperial times, however, pre·
ferred them to the drama proper, ¹
so that they practically drove the
latter from the stage. Cf. also ,
