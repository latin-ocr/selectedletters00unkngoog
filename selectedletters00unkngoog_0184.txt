gests that Trebatius showed more tius had been so fond of combats

discretiori as a soldier, in keeping
out of range, than he did as a law·
yer. The same pun occurs in an-
other letter to Trebatius (Fam. 7. 6.

⁴ 2) tu, qui ceteris cavere didicisti, in

Britannia ne ab essedariis decipia-
ris caveto. One of the main sources
oi humor in Cicero's letters to
Trebatius lies in the double mean-
ing which he gives to judicial
terms,— a form of wit which would
appeal forcibly to the legal mind
of Trebatius3 cf. placebat and
censeo above and respondere in
the foregoing letter. Cf. also Cic.

dangers and hardships of the Brit·

batius’s fondness ior swimming

in Rome that his friends had not
been able to keep him away, even
from the shows where blindfolded
warriors fought on horseback. lt
is strange, therefore, that he feels
so little interest in seein'g similar
contests in Britain. The essedarii
were especially dreaded hy the
Roman soldiers. — defraudare: a
colloquial word, which, though
common enough in Plautus and
Terence, Cicero uses elsewhere
perhaps only in a proverbial er·
pressiori, Or. 221.

3. mercule: this oath isfound
in Cicero’s correspondence in the
forms, hercules, mehercules (or
mercules), and mehercule (or mer·
cule). Cicero himself writes (Or.
157) mehercule libentius dixerim
quam mehercules, and the more
polished letter-writers of this pe·
riod seem to have agreed with
birni-hominem: cf. homini, Ep·
