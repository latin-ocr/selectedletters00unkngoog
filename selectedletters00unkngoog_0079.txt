96. Extravagance in Expression. Formal literarycompo-
sitions which are intended lor publication, and which must
therefore submit to the criticism oi the general public, are
more reserved in their expression than is the familiar inter-
course between friends‚ whether carried on by conversation or
correspondence. Abundant illustration oi this lact is offered
in the letters which passed between Cicero and his intimate
friends, both in the use of single words and complete state·
ments eg. immortalis=magnas (Plancus Fam. 10. 11. 1):
e‘mmortalis aga tibi gratias,· infinitis=multis (Pollio, Fam.
ro. 32. 4): infinitis pollicitationibus. Cf. also nam, cum maxi-
mam cepissem laetitiam ex humanissimi et carissimi patris
epistularem vero iucundissimae tuae litterae cumulum milri
gaudii attulerunt (Cicero filius, Fam. 16. 21. 1). Cf. note
to demiror, Epist. XXVI. 4.

97'. Greek Words aad Plerases. ,As Tyrrell remarksl
Greek words and phrases generally appear in the Corre-
spondence as technical terms in philosophy, rhetoric, politics,
medicine, and as slang phrases Doubtless‚ also, as Cicero
himself intimateS‚ Greek was occasionally used as apossible
protection if a letter should iall into the hands of an enemy.
The Greek technical terms played the same part with ref-
erence to Latin that many oi the corresponding technical
terms horrowed from Latin play in modern composition,
while the Greek popular expressions in the Letters may be
compared with current French phrases. Cf. also note to
παρρησίαν, Epist. V. 8. '

98. Exclamatory Questraas. These questions belong to
the language of everyday life, and almost every one ol the
familiar letters offers illustrations oi the use oi such exclam-
atory phrases as quid iamt car leae? etc. Cf. also ἓ 92
and note lo quid quaeris, Epist. V. 4.

99. Figuratiae Language. One of the most pronounced
