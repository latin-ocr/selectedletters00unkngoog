Faberius, Antony proceeded to strengthen himself by alter-
ing Caesar's papers and· even by forging new documents.²
To all this the senate could offer no resistance‚ but the
further development of Antony’s plans was interrupted by
the arrival in April of C. Octavius,⁸ Caesar’s adopted son

ratione, nihr'lordine.⁷ He decided to leave Italy for a time
and was actually at Leucopetra on his way to Greece when
he heard that a reconciliation between Antony and the

liberatores was probable.⁸ On hearing this news, he returned
