CICERO’S LETTERS.

praeconio, At vide quid suscenseat. Phameae causam 2
receperam, ipsius quidem causa, erat enim mihi sane
familiaris. Is ad mevenit dixitque iudicem sibi ope-
ram dare constituisse eo ipso die quo de P. Sestio in
consilium iri necesse erat. Respondi nullo modo me
facere posse; quem vellet alium diem si sumpsisset,
me ei non defuturum.= Ille autem, qui sciret se nepo-
tem bellum tibicinem habere et sat bonum unctorem,
discessit a me, ut mi videbatur, iratior. Habes ‘Sar- Ι
dos venalis, alium alio nequiorem' Cognosti meam
causam et istius salaconis iniquitatem. ‘Catonem’
tuum mihi mitte3 cupio enim legere. Me adhuc non
legisse ‘turpe utrique nostrum est. , ·

vus represented led apparently to
a correspondence between them
(cf. Tac. Dial. 18). As a poet,

Calvus belonged to the νεώτεροι,
(Att. 7. 2. ι), and was an inti·

during the latter’s canvass for the
consulship (cf. Aa. 13. 49. 1).-
1³. Sestio: Sestius was apparently
charged with ambitus ; cf. Art. 13.
49. 1.—in consilium iri: cum

mate fn'end of Catullus, the
leading representative of 'that
school. He died about 47 1³.C.;
cf. Fam. ¹5· 21. 4. Calvus had
assailed Tigellius in a poem, the
first verse of which, preserved by
Porphyrio (Hor. Sat. 1. 3. 4), is as
follows: Sardi Tigelli putzilum
caput venit (from aenea). On the
order Calvi Licini, cf. Galli
Canini, Ep. XIX. 4 n.— Hippo-
nacteo: Hipponax was a Greek
writer of lampoons. — praeconio:
the setting forth by an auctioneer
of the merits of his wares3 sug-
gested by the line from Calvus.

2. Phameae: cf. Ep. LXI.8 n.
Tigelliuswas annoyed at Cicero for
neglecting to act as the advocate of
Phamea, his grandfather (or uncle),
after having promised to do so
(cf. Aa. 13· 49. 1).-—ipsius qui-
dem causa: Phamea had prof-
fered his assistance to Cicero

iudices, dc reo sententias laturi, in
unum coeunt, ire in causalium di-
cuntur (Manutius). Cf, however,
Ep. V. introd. note-ille: ia.
Phamea—sat bonum: this ar-
chaic form of satis (cf. Ter. And.
deliniabant talla
prose, cf. pro Rosc. Am. 893
de Or. 3. 843 Art. 14. ro. 1.-
unctorem: the reference is ob
scure. Manutius suggests canto-
rem. - Sardos venalis: the Sar-
dinian slaves were weak and sickly
because of the unhealthful climate
of their native country. Hence
the proverb: ‘Sardi venales ,¹ alius
alio nequior? Cf. Otto, Spricla-
wd'rter der Homer, 308.- Cato-
nem tuum: probably a political
biography of Cato. Cf. Intr. 33.
