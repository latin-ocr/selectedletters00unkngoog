XLVIII. Place of writing un-

1. tuum: opposed to nostro
below. — nugax: adjectives in ax
are found relatively much more
frequently in colloquIal Latin3 cf,
ag, Plaut. Pers. 410, 4213 Capt.
9593 Petron. 435 132. Cicero in
his own letters uses only one such
adjective, tagax (Art. 6. 3. 15. ln
the letters to Cicero we find minax
(Fam. 11. 3. 153 pugnax (Fam. 8.
13· 1 and 10. 31. 55; efficax (Fam.
8. 10. 353 sagax (Fam. 10. 23. 45,
and nugax here-commorit: for
syncopation in the Letters‚ cf. Intr.
82. The loss of v in the perfect
tenses ol maaca and its compounds
is peculim, since the lost letter is
not the sign of the perfect system
but belongs to the stem. Cf.
Priscian, 10. 3. 16 (Keil, Il. 508),
upon this point -temperatio·

RubiconJan. 10 ,49ac., ol theold
calendar, but as the titue ol year =
was really late autumn, the season 5
was not in itself unfavorable to 5
military operations; but his troops ἶ
had been obligedv to make a diffi· 5

ln this campaign of two months
Caesar had invested northern
Italy, and made 30,ooo men pris· .

engagement. Upon quid est, cf. ’
