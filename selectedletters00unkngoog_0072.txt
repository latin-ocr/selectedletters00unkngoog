Tlcc Substantiam

83. (a) The accusative is used a little more ireely in i
the Letters than in formal literature. It ¹occurs after 1

verbs oi thought and the expression oi thought, and
alter verbs signiiying ta striae, to langii, to nme, etc.;
eg. leaena te praesens contendissem (Cael, Fam. 8. 16. 4);
Cntnlnm milei narras (Fam. 9. 15. 3); iurare lovem Lapidem
(Eam. 7. 12. 2); qnam primum llaec risum oeni (Cael, Fam.
8. 14. 4). Two accusatives occur in a iew instances aiter
verbs signiiying to scek, to marn, etc.; eg. illud antem tc
peto (Dolabella, Fam. 9. 9. 2); qnod et respublica mcetnostra
amicitia lzartatar (Cata, Fam.. 15. 5. 1); andan adverbial
accusative made up oi partem and the adjective magnam ‚or
macarem or minimam is found several times; eg. curare
soles libenter, nt ega maiorem partem nileil curare (Cael. Fam.
8. 9. 3). Ci. note to qnod me hortatur, Epist. XXXVII. 1.

(b) With the exception oi a lew Grecisms‚ eg. cogitata
dignissima tuae virtutis (BalbuS, Act. 8. rga. 1), the only
thing noteworthy with respect to the genitive consists in the
'rather free use of the genitive oi quality and the partitive
genitive. Cf. aliqua terraram, Epist. LXXXVI. 3 n.

(c) The alatim af reference and the ctltical datiae are
great favorites in the Letters‚ the latter especially with ot,
ecce, and lzic. Perhaps in their use oi the ethical dative
Cicero and his correspondents have been surpassed only by
the writers oi comedy. Cf. ecce tili et Bruti ct tuae litterae ἶ
(Att. 14. 19. 1); at illc tibi . . . pergit Brundesium (Act. 8.
8. 2). Cf. also notes to minori curae, Epist. XXV. 2, and to y
ecce, Epist. XXXV. 2 3.

(al) Certain public events, recurring at regular or irreg·
ular intervals‚ were oi such importance in the eyes of the y
people that they were used in marking the date of an event. ¹
