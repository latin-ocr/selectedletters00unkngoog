1 Varie sum adfectus tuis litteris, valde priore pagina
perturbatus, paulum altera recreatus Quare nunc
quidem non dubito quin, quoad plane valeas, te neque
navigationi neque viae committas, Satis te mature
videro, si plane confirmatum videro De medico et
tu bene existimari scribis et ego sic audio; sed plane
curationes eius 'non probo; ius enim dandum tibi non
fuit, cum κακοστόμαχος esses; sed tamen etad illum ἵ
2scripsi accurate et ad Lysonem. Ad Curium vero, ἵ
suavissimum hominem et summi offici summaeque
humanitatis, multa scripsi, in iis etiam, ut, si tibi vide-

7 n.-re publica meliore: the
violent discussions in the senate
conceming a successor to Caesar
were at their height.

XXXIX. Leucas, Nov. 7, 5013.c.
Cicero apparently left Tarsus July
30 (ci. Fam. 2. 17. 1), and, after a
delay of several weeks in Rhodes
and Ephesus, reached the Piraeus
Oct. 14. Toward the end of the
mouth he set out by land for
Rome. Tiro, who was with him.
was taken ill on the way, and was
left behind at Patrae, while Cicero
continued his Journey through
Alyzia and Leucas.

1. existimari: probably imper-
sonal, although after de intro-
ducing a transition we find such
loose constructions that it would
be possible to consider existimari

personal with an omitted eum for
its subject. Cf. de Quinto fratrc.
scito eum non 'mediocriter laborare.
etc, Att. 10. r 5. 4. — ius, serap.—
κακοστόμαχοςτ as the physicians
were usually Greeks,technical med-
ical expressions were in Greek. Cf.
the prescription which Cicero urges
upon Tiro (Fam. 16. 18. tl: en
(i.e. valetudo) quid postulet, non
ignoras ; πέψιν, duorlar, περίπατοι
σύμμετρον, τρῖψιν, εὐλυσίαν κοιλίας.
- Lysonem: Tiro was staying at
Lyso’s house.

2. Curium: M.'·Cnrius, a Ro
man knight carrying on a banking
business in Patrae. The one letter
which we have from him, Fam. 7.
29, full as it is of commercial
terms, would of itself betray his
calling. Fam. 7. 28, 30, and 31
