62, The letter regularly opened and closed with certain
formulae which varied according to the relations in which the
writer and recipient stood. ’ Thus, in writing toan intimate
friend like PaetuS, Cicero might open his letter thus: Cicero
Paeto,l or Cicero Pae'to S? (ie. salutern), or Cicero Paeto S. θ’
(ie. salutem dicit); or in a little more formal letter the prae-
nomen or cognomen of one or of both might be added, eg.
M. Cicero S. D. A. Caecinae⁴ or Cicero S. D. M. Fadio Gallo.⁸
In formal letters, ifeither the writer or the recipient held an
office, his title was added, eg. M. Cicero Imp. S. D. L. Paulo
Cos.⁸; still more formally, M. Tullius M. F. Cicero Procas.
S. D. Cos. Pr. Tr. Pl. Senatui? (ie. M. Tullius Marci filius
Cicero pro consule salutern dicit consulibus praetoribus tribunis
plebis senatui). ί

In addressing the members of one’s own family it was
customary to add Suo (or Suae), e.g. Tullius Terentiae Suae
S. P.⁸ (ie. salutem plurimam). After this address there
often appeared some formula like si vales, bene est, either
written out in full or in the abbreviation s. v. b. e. or s. o. b.
(ie. berust).⁸ Cicero himself rarely used this formula.¹⁰

In writing to the members of one’s own household, appar-
ently some closing formula was ordinarily used. ·Such
formulae are found at the end of all the letters to Terentia
and to Tiro. Among those used are the following: vale,
ctiam atque ctiam vale, vale salve, sac valeas meque diltgas,

cura ut valeas, ama nos et vale.ll In writing to others than ἵ
