χχ ἡ INTRODUCTION.

10. ln December of this year, while Caesar was absent
in Spain, a festival was heldat his house in honor ol the
goddess Bona Dea, which it was unlawful for men to attend3
but during the meeting, P. Clodius, a patrician, was found
to be present in disguise (ci. Epist V.). A judicial
investigation of the matter was made, but Clodius secured
, an acquittal through the kind offices of Crassus, who
bribed a majority of the jurors. Cicero does not seem to
have taken an active part in the discussion of the Clodian
matter in the senate,¹' but whe'n, in the trial, Clodius
attempted to establish an alibi by offering evidence to
prove that he was at Interamna, ninety miles from Rome,
at the time of the sacrilege, Cicero went on the witness
stand and testified that he had seen Clodius in Rome within
three hours of the time he claimed to have been at Inter-
amna²

The anger ol Clodius was aroused still more by the humil·
iation which he suffered in debate at Cicero's hands,3 so
that henceiorth he thought of little else than avenging
himself upon Cicero. The clash between Clodius and the

· senate, and the desire which Clodius felt to injure Cicero,

threw Clodius into the arms of the democratic party, so
that the affair, which at the outset wasa purely personal
one, developed into' a political antagonism.⁴

11. In Jan, 61 nc, before tbe trial of Clodius took place, Ἴ
Pompey returned from the East. Both the senatorial party
and the democratic party were anxious to secure his support3 j
but, with that fatuity which characterized his conduct so
often, he satisfied neither taction. The senate, however, l
found an opportunity to punish him for his coldness toward Ἴ
them by declining either to ratify his arrangements in the ,
