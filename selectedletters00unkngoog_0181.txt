CICERO’S LETTERS.

3 deinde quod τῶν Βρεττα-

νῶν minus φιλοθέωρον te praebuisti, plane non repre-
hendo. Nunc vero in hibernis iniectus mihi videris,
itaque te commovere non curas.

Vsquequaque sapere oportet, id erit telum acerrimum.

Ego si foris cenitarem, Cn. Octavio familiari tuo non 2
defuissem, cui tamen¹ dixi, cum me aliquotiens invi-

1. Equo Troiano: cf. Ep. XIX.
2 n. - sero sapiunt: Cicero
quotes here, as he did in Ep. XIX.
2(si sciens sallo), the first words
of a familiar passage, which had
passed into a proverb. The ex-
pression is thus explained by F es·
tus, l. 510, de Pon. τ ‘sera sapiunt
Phryges' prouerbium est natum a
Troianis qui decimo denique anno
uelle caeperunt Helenam quaeque
ciens eaerantrapta reddere. Cf. also
Ribbeck, Rern. Tragia — non se-
ro: Trebatius had gone to Caesar
nith such rosecolored ideas of a
soldier’s life and of the immediate
wealth and distinction to be won
in it, that the inevitable hardships
and monotony made him discon-
tented and homesick, so that Cic·
ero had written him reprovingly:
primarum mensum litteris tuis ue-
hementer commovebar, quod milei
interdum — paee tua dixerim —
lauis in urbis urbanitatisque desi-
deria, interdum piger, interdum
timidus in labere militari, saepe
autem etiam, qued a te alienissi-
mum est, subimpudens videbare,·
{anquam enim syngrapham ad
inperatorem, nen epistulam attu-
lisses, etc„ Fam. 7. 17. 1. This
letter evidently had the effect in-
tended, for Cicero’s words, non
sero, as well as mi vetule, indi-
cate that Trebatius had repented

a triste erazy. Cf. pulchellus, Ep.
V. 10 n. The phrase, rabiosulas
sat fatuae, is probably quoted
from some comic poet. Cf, how-
ever, Ribbeck, Com. Rom. Frag.
p. νῆν-τῶν Βρεττανῶν minus
ψιλοθὲωρον, nat very fond es see-
ing the sigalis in Britain. In the
summer ot 55 nc. Caesar made
his first expedition to Britain, in
which Trebatius did not care to
join. — in hibernis iniectus: Cic·
ero is writing toward the end ol
November. — te commovere, to
stir; as ¹of one crawling out from
under a blanket in cold weather. -
usquequaque, etc: probably the
words of Ulysses in the same play
from which the quotation sero
sapiunt was taken. Cf. Ribbeck,
Ri'm. T rag. p. 49, and T rag. Ram.
Frag. p. 246.-7sapere: perhaps
with a double meaning, to be wise
and te be learned iu tlte law. Cf.
Ep. XXV. r n.—id erit telum
acerrimum: Mezger quotes Fal·
staff’s words, ‘Discretion is the
better part of valor.’

2. cenitarem: this frequentative
is not found in Cicero outside of
the Letters—Cn. Octavio: evi·
dently a pushing ieRow, who
wanted the distinction of enter-
taining Cicero. Cf. Fam. 7. 9. 3
Cn. Octavius est an Cn. Cornelius
quidam, tuus santiliaris, summa

olbis discontent.—primas illas': genere natus, terrae filius. Is me,

sc. tuas epistulas. — rabiosulas,

quia scit tuum familiarem esse,
