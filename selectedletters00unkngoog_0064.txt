The extant collections contain about 870 letters, of which
423 are included in the Bks. ad Fam, 394 in the Bks. al
Ata, and the remainder is divided almost equally between
the other two collections. The correspondence contains 98
letters from 31 other persons than Cicero Seventy-three ol
these letters are found in the Bks. ad Fam.

66. The collection of letters cul Fam. seems to be made up
ol three parts¹: (i) Bk. 13, (ii) Bks. r-9 and 14-16, (iii) Bks.
10-12. The letters of Bk. 13 are all letters oi recommenda-
tion, and were probably collected and perhaps published in
the summer of 44 ae. Of the other books, 1-9 and
14-16 contain epistles, other than letters ol recommendation,
written before the summer of 44 ss.c.; and Bks. 10-12 con·
tain letters written later than that date. The date ol
publication of parts ii and iii is not known. In view oi the
criticisms made upon Antorly in some ol these letterS, per-
haps they were not published until after the battle oi Actium,
or still later.² The title Epistulae acl Familiares is modern.

Ti10,Cicero’s secretary, was making a collection oi Cicero’s
letters in 44 B.c.³ The collection of letters ad Fam. contains
no letters from Ti10,butmanyaddressed to him, even by
other people than Cicero. He is therefore almost certainly
the editor ol this collection. Ι

67. The collection acl Atticum contains no letter from
Atticus. This state of things, together with the well-known
lact that Atticus was a publisher, and that Cornelius Nepos
says⁴ that such a collection of Cicero's letters, not yet
published, was in the possession of Atticus, makes it almost
certain that these letters were arranged ior publication by Β
him. Itis probable that they were not published until l
