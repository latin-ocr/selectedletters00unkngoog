CRlTICAL APPENDIX.

-ωωμμ,

ΙΝ this Appendix many of the most important variations in the text
of this edition from that of the Medicean codices (M. 49, 9and 49, 18)
are indicated, and the most probable conjectures for some of the doubt-
ful passages are presented. The source of many of these conjectures Ἴ ‚
has not been indicated on account of the difficulty of tracing them to
their authors. Mere orthographical variations have not been noted.
For the benefit of those who may wish to make a more'careful study

of a portion of the text, the critical notes have been made somewhat ,

fuller for the first fortythree letters than for the rest. Α complete
apparatus criticus of the Epistulae ad familiares may be found in Men·
delssohn’s edition. The adnotatio cm'tica of CeF. W. Miiller con·
taius critical notes on the Epistulae ad Quintum fratrem. For the
Epistulae ad Atticum the student may be referred to the editions of
Orelli, Baiter and Kayser, Wesenberg, and Tyrrell. These editions con-
tain critical notes on the other letters of Cicero also. The other prin·
cipal sources of information are C. Α. Lehmann, Quaestioues Tullianae,
and Dc Ciceronis ad Atticum epistulis recensendis et emendandis, Th.
Schiche, Zu Ciceros Briefen an Atticus, P. Starker, Symbolac Criticae ad
M. Tullii Ciceronis epistulas, Ο. Streicher, De Ciceronis epistolis ad
familiares emendandis, and 0. Ε. Schmidt’s edition of Bks. XII and
XIII of the Epistulae ad Atticum.
