Epist. XLII, intr.) to the senate Jan. 1, 49 u.'c., when the con·
suls L. Lentulus Crus and C. Claudius Marcellus assumed
office. Caesar’s proposals were not accepted, and a resolu-
tion was passed declaring that he would be acting adversus
rempublicam it he did not give up his army by July 1, 49 B.c.¹;
3ηά οη Jan.7 the senatusconsultum ultimum ²was passed, upon
which the tribunes Antonius aud Cassius,l as well as Curio
and Caelius, set out for Caesar's camp. .

28. Cicero's position made him an eminently fit person Ι
·to effect a compromise.4 He proposed that Pompey should ¹
go to Spain, and that Caesar should not be compelled to
attend his ¹cauvass in person ὅ; but his efforts were fruitless.
On Jan. ro Caesar crossed the Rubicon⁶ with five cohorts
and marched toward Rome, taking Pisaurum, Fanum, and
Ancona on his way. On Jan. 14 the senate passed the
decretum tumultus,⁷ but the news of Caesar's rapid advance
forced Pompey, the consuls, 3ηά senators to leave Rome,8
Jan. 17, and hurry southward.

29. Cicero left the city the same day. The senate had
assigned the Campanian district to him, but he saw that
little could be done,l because the inhabitants of Campania ,
had many ol them received their lands through Caesar's Ἴ
law (ἕ 13). Furthermore he hoped ior peace, 3ηά thought
that neutrality on his part would best fit him toact as
mediator between the opposing forces3 and to maintain his l
neutral position, he gave up his appointment in Campania
just before leaving the city, and took charge, ina civil capa· ,
city, ol the Roman Campagna 3ηά the coast oi Latium¹⁰ ³
