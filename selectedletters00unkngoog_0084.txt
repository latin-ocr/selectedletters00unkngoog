' 2 CICERO'S LETTERS.

[Ep. l.

hoc percrebrescit, plurimos nostros amicos inveniri
Nos autem initium prensandi facere cogitaramus eo
ipso ternpore quo tuum puerum cum his litteris profi-
cisci Cincius dicebat, in campo comitiis tribuniciis
a. d. xvt Kalend. Sextiles, CompetitoreS, qui certi
esse videantur, Galba et Antonius et Q. Cornificius—
puto te in hoc aut risisse aut ingemuisse, ut frontem
ferias, sunt qui etiarn Caesonium putent. Aquilium
non arbitramur, qui denegat et iuravit morbum et illud
suurn regnum iudiciale opposuit; Catilina, si iudicatum ·
erit meridie non lucere, certus erit competitor; de
Aufidio et de Palicano non puto te exspectare dum

epistolary tenses, representing re·
spectively the perfect and present;
cf. Intr. 84 c. The statement is put

puerum, servant,· referring to the
tabellarius (see Intr. 64). -Cin-
cius: one of the agents (procura-
tores) οἱ Atticus— a.d. xvi Ka·
lend. Sextiles: this was not the
formal announcement (professio)
on Cicero’s part of his intention
of standing for the consulship, as
the latter would be made on the
· day on which notice of the election
was given, ie. three nundinae, or
17 days, before the day of the
election. Cf. Herzog, 1. p. 656,
1092, n. 2.-Antonius: Cicero's
colleague in 63 tac—Q. Corni-
ficius: the father of the orator
and politician Q. Cornificius, to
’ whom Fam. 12. 17-30 are ad-
dressed.—risisse aut ingemu-
isse: on hearing that such no-
bodies aspire to the consulship.
The situation, while humorous, is
also one to excite the indignation

mi, nulla corporis, frons non prr·
cussa, nonsrmur. Cicero speaks
ot Caesonius in a very different
way in Verr. i. 29 homo in rebus
iudicandis spectatus rt cognitus. -
Aquilium: sc. competitorem sore.
C.Aquilius Gallus was praetorwith ¹
Cicero in 66 lae—iuravit mor-
bum: the simple acc. after iurare
is rare. The phrase is probablya
legal one; cf. Fam. 8. 8. 3 cum
columniam iurasset. lurore mor·
bum means ‘to take an oath that
one is ill' as an excuse for the non-
perforrnance of some duty. — reg·
num iudiciale: Aquilius was a}
well-known jurist (pro Caec. 77).l
too much occupied with legal*
business to engage in politics. Cf. ἵ
regno forensi, Ep. LXII. 1. — iu=l
dicatum erit: in the approaching=
trial of Catiline for misappropria· ¹
tion of public funds. The accuser
was Cicero’s subsequent enemy¹
