alter his death (32 Β.ο.).1 Some ol the men of note upon
whom Cicero had expressed unfavorable opinions were still
living in 32 ac, and the publication of these letters would
therefore have been indiscreet. The books in the collection
ad Att. stand in chronological order, and the letters within
the books are arranged chronologically, but not with
accuracy.

With the Epistulae ad Quintum fratrem may be mentioned
the Commentarzblum petitionis? a document which Quintus
sent to his brother when the latter was a candidate for the
consulship. The letters proper, as well as the Epistulae ad
M. Brutum, were edited by Τίῐο.3 There were originally
nine books ot the letters to Brutus, but seven of them have
been lost.¹ Those which remain are probably Blrs. 9 and8
ol the original collection. The authenticity of the Epist.
. ad M Brut. has been seriously doubted, but, with the
exception perhaps ol 1. 16 and 17,⁴ they are now commonly
regarded as authentic.

Middle Ages are found,⁵ but they do not seem to have
been as well known as his philosophical writings. In the
year 1389, however, Coluccio Salutato, the Florentine chan-

script which was found to contain the Epist. ad Fam.⁶ This
manuscript and the copy secured by Coluccio are now in the ¹
