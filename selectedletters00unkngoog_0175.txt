buni aerarii for acquittal. The
guilt or innocence of the accused
party was, however, decided by a
majoriton all the iudices, andin

this instance there was a majority '

oi four for acquittal. The num-
beros jurors sitting in a trial was
detennined by the statute under
which the charge was brought; the
lowest number mentioned is 32, the
highest 75 (cf. Madvig, Verſs u.
Verw. II. 308).-Vatinium: P.
Vatinius had made himself noto
rious during his tribuneship as
Caesar’s agent, but escaped punish-
ment for his misdeeds. In 57 aa.
he failed as a candidate tor the
aedileship. Iu 56 he appeared as
a witness against Sestius, whom
Cicero was defending and Cicero
attached him mercilessly. (Cf.
eg. pro Seri. 132 ff.; in Vat. latera,-
Fam. 1. 9. 7; Qsr. 2. 4. 1.) The trial
here referred to was on an accusa*
tion de sodaliciis in 54 ac. Cicero
undertook the defense at Caesar's
request. For Cicero's explanation
of his conduct, ct. Fam. 1. 9. 19.
It is a significant fact that in his

postponement of the consular elec·

sius, 40. 17.-Seauri iudicium:
the charge of misgovemment in
Sardinia had been brought against
Scaurus in July, but the trial had
been postponed for 30 days.—
