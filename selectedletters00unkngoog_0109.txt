CICERO'S LETTERS.

ct 'iucunda consuetudine coniuncti inter nos sumus
usque eo, ut nostri isti comissatores coniurationis,
barbatuli iuvenes, illum in sermonibus Cn. Ciceronem

appellent. Itaque et ludis

et gladiatoribus mirandas

ἐπισημασίας sine ulla pastoricia fistula auferebamus.
Nunc est exspectatio comitiorum, in quae omnibusinvi- 12
tis trudit noster Magnus Auli filium, atque in eo neque
auctoritate neque gratia pugnat, sed quibus Philippus
omnia castella expugnari posse dicebat in quae modo

asellus onustus auro posset

ascendere ; consul autem

ille deterioris histrionis similis suscepisse negotium
dicitur et domi divisores habere, quod ego non credo,

raignment of Pompey: nihil come,

Mommsen explains it, or that the
friendship between Cicero and
Pompeywas so close as to make
thern one. -ludis et gladiatori-
bus: colloquial ablatives of time.
Cf. lntr. 83 d. Such colloquial
ablatives Cicero has with one ex-
ception (Plilr'pp. 9. 16) avoided
outside the letters. The ludi re·
ferred to were probably the ludi
Megalenses in April. -ἐπισημα-

the games were being held. For a
smilar scene when Caesar and
Curio entered the theatre, cf. Ep.

Afranius. By designating him as
Auli filium Cicero means perhaps
that Afranius was himself a man of
