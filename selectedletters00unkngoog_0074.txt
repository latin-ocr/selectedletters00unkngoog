·is but a single example of ne with the indefinite second
person present subjunctive in a prohibition’¹; and that,
furthermore, prohibitions expressed by ne with the present
or the perfect subjunctive, lack the dignity of the netelcon-
struction, and are consequently confined to informa] Latin.²
Quite naturally, therefore, many of these prohibitions
expressed by ne with the present subjunctive, and the
majority of those expressed by ne with the perfect subjunc-
tive, to be found in classical prose, are in the correspond-
ence of Cicer0,³ and twelve of the fourteen cases of the last-

two, occur in letters to Cicero’s most familiar correspond-
entS, eg. ‘tu, malum,' inquies, ‘actum ne agas' (Att. 9. 18. 3),
iocum autem illius de sua egestate neris aspernatus (Q. fr.
, 2.10(12). 5).

(c) The so-called epistolery use es the tenses is the com·
monest peculiarity in the use of tenses to be found in
the Letters. The writer of the letter imagines ¹himself in
the place of the recipient, and therefore uses a tense of past
time in speaking of an event which was exactly or approxi-
rnately contemporaneous with the'writing of the letter.
This usage is most frequent with verbs indicating the writ-
ing of a letter, or the sending of a letter or messenger,⁴ as
ego tibi aliquid de meis serpitis mittam: nihil eret absoluti
Ἰ (Art. 1. 16. 18); quae milei veniebantin mentem, quaeadte
pertinere arbitrabar, quod in Ciliciam proficiscebar, existimavi
me ad te oportere scribere (Fam. 2. 18. 3). Cf. also note to
presteti sumus, Epist. XI. 3.

habere with the perfect participle passive, but if a few cases
