Chronicle says: T. Lueretius poeta
. . . cum aliquot libras per inter-
valla insaniae consm'psrkset, quos
postea Cicero emendavit, etc. This
statement that Cicero edited the
poem de Rerum Natura has given
rise to a deal oi discussion. It is
certainly true that Cicero and Lu·
cretius exerted an Influence upon
each other. Lucretius borrowed
freely from Cicero's Aratea, while
several passages in the philosoph-
ical writings oi Cicero closely
resemble verses of Lucretius (cf.
Martha, Le Polme de Lucrlce, 3 51,
Munro on Lucr. 5. 619, and Merrill
in Class. Rev. for 1896, 19).—

Trebatius Testa, the date oi whose l

birthis uncertain, came as a boy
to Rome to study law. He be·

came attached to Cicero, and l

pleased the latter by both his wit
and good-fenowship, and also as-
sisted him by his knowledge of

jurisprudence. Being anxious, ,

however, to see something of the
world, to win his spurs, and to
make a fortune, perhaps, in the

provinces, Trebatius set out for ¹

the Roman camp in Gaul, carrying
with him this letter of recommen-
dation. Cicero’s relations with
Trebatius were of a most Intimate
nature, as his seventeen letters to
him (Fam. 7. 6:22) prove. Like
most of the young men who served
upon Caesar's staff in Gaul, Treba·

tius became his devoted admirer, ι

Civil War. He was one oi the few ἶ
