which Cassius won over the Parthians near Antioch averted
the threatened invasion ol Cilicia, and Cicero directed his
forces against the independent people near Mt. Amanus‚¹
where, after a complete victory, he had the satisfaction of ἵ
hearing himself saluted ‘imperator’ by his troops.²

Tarsus and sent thence official letters to the consuls ¹
asking for a supplr'cati0,⁸ accompanied by a letter of similar ,
purport to Cat0, the senatorial leader.⁴ The senate voted ¹

, the supplicatio,⁵ and, turning over his province to the

quaestor Caelius Caldus, on July 30, Cicero set out on his
homeward journey in high hopes of a triumph. There is no
more honorable, period in Cicero's life than that oi his pro
consulship in Cilicia ς and with the difficulties which he had
to iace, and the poor means at his disposal, his success as
an administrator was highly creditable. The fact that he
did not reorganize his province on a permanent basis, as
Caesar reorganized Gaul, is to be attributed to the shortness
of his tenure of office and the wretchedness of the aristo· Ἴ
cratic system oi government, and not to Cicero’s own
inability or unwillingness. Cicero traveled slowly home-
ward¹ hythe way of Rhodes⁶ and Athens accompanied by

. his brother, his son, his nephew, and his ireedman Tiro, who

was obliged to remain at Patrae on account oi illness.⁷ On
Nov. 24, 50 nc, he reached Brundisium, where he was met
by his wile Terentia⁸ After a delay oi several weeks. at
his villas near Naples, Cicero at last reached Rome, Jan. 4,
49 e.c.‚⁹ aiter an absence from the city oi a year and eight

months.
