Aa. 1. 16.] CICERO’S LETTERS. 15

scire quo modo ego minus quam soleam proeliatus
sim. Respondebo tibi ὕστερον πρότερον Ὁμηρικῶς. Ego
enim, quam diu senatus auctoritas mihi defendenda
luit, sic acriter et vehementer proeliatus sum ut clamor
concursusque maxima cum mea laude fierent, Quod
si tibi umquam sum visus in re publica fortis, certe me
in illa causa admiratus esses. Cum enim ille ad con-
tiones confugisset, in iisque meo nomine ad invidiam
uteretur, di immortales! quas ego pugnas et quantas

criminal trials in a Roman court
was entrusted to the praetor, his
consilium, and the iudices. The
praetor passed upon questions oi
law, in the decision of which he
was assisted by the consilium, a
body of jurists called in to give
legal advice, while questions of
lact were relegated to the iudices.
Alist of several hundred iudices,
chosen under the lex Aurelia of
70 sc. from the ranks of the sen-
ators, knights, and tribuni aerarii
(fiscal officials ot the tribes; ci.
Momm. St. R. III. 189-196)‚ was
published at the beginning oi
each year. From this list the
iudices for a particular trial were
selected by lot. A verdict ren-
dqquld by a majority ol'them was
v 1.

(1) why the trial of Clodius re-
sulted so unexpectedly in an ac-
quittal; (2) why Cicero proved so
poqr a fighter. Cicero replies
to the second question first, the
enswer extending to the sentence,
tuuc, si causam, etc, 2, and then
to the first one. He applies to
this inverted order the phrase
ὕστερον πρότερον Ὁμηρικῶς, be-
cause, in the first book'of the
Qdyssey, Odysseus is introduced
n the midst of his wanderings,

his previous adventures being
narrated in subsequent books.-
quod . . . factum sit: the sub-
junctive is used because the rea·
son is urged by Atticus—sena-
tus auctoritas: cf. Att. r. 14. 5
cum decerneretur frequenti senatu,
contra pugnante Pisone, ad pedes
amnium singillatim accidente Cla·
dio, ut consules populum coharta-
rentur ad rogationem accipiendam.
—ille2 Clodius—curn . . . ute-
retur: after the passage in the
senate of the resolution given
above, Clodius contiones miseras
habebat, in quibus Lucullum, Har- -
tensium, C. Pisonem, Messallam
consulem contumeliose laedebat ; mc
tantum ‘comperisse’ amnia crimi-
nabatur (Art. r. 14. 5). The word
‘comperi' Cicero had unfortu-
nately used so often with reference
to the movements of the Catili·
narian conspirators (cf. in Cat. 1.
10 and 3. 4) that it had evidently
become a byword with his enemies,
and was used by Clodius in taunt·
ing him; ci. also Fam. 5. 5. 2.-
quas ego, etc: ci. also proeliatus
sum above. Just such extravagant
figures drawn from military life as
Plautus puts into the mouth of
the scheming slave or parasite
who has outgeneraled his oppo-
nent; cf. eg. Capt. 153, M. G.
815, 1156, and the striking passage
