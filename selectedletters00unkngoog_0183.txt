ceteri non propter superbiam eius sed propter occupa-

nihil mihi scripsisti de tuis rebus, quae mercule mihi
non minori curae sunt quam meae. Valde metuo ne
frigeas in hibernis. Quamobrem camino luculento

A similar jest at end of Ep. XXIV.

Trebatius were apparently written
in a personal and humorous vein.

2. minori curae: colloquial
Latin showed a fondness for the
predicate dative after esse,· and
curae, often with an adjective,
magnae, minori, summae, etc., is
very frequently found in this con·
struction— valde metuo, etc,
Ι am very nruclr afraid tlrat you
are suffering srom cold in your
winter qmrters ; so Ι advisa you
to keep a bright flre going on tlte
lrearth (Mucius anal Manilius liold
inc same opinion), especially as you
are not well supplied willa clotln'ng
for a campaign, and yet Ι under-
stand that you find it lot enough
over there just at present. The
humor oi the passage consists in
the rapid transition from the lit·

of certain words, and in the cita·

-sagis non abundares: inas·
much as Trebatius is not well sup·
plied with heavy garments, and the
weather is told, his only protection
lies in keeping a good fire3 but the
sagum was the typical garment of
a soldier, as the toga was the main
article in the dress of a civilian
(thus sagati, Non. ΙΙ. 202, Milli, is
opposed to togati), and to say that
Trebatius was not well supplied
with saga implied that he avoided
the dangers of the campaign. -
