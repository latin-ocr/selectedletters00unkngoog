pugillares. For letters, however, sent to a distance, as most‘n
of Cicero's were, papyrus was a much more convenient sub-
stance, and probably the great majority oi his letters were
written upon it.¹ Parohment had not yet come into use fo)
letter writing.2

60. The papyrus plant was grown principally in Egypt.
It grpws in water two or three feet deep, and the plant
reaches a height oi five or six teet. The methodos manu-
facturing writing material from it is described by· Pliny.⁸
The stem of the plant was cut into thin strips, and these
strips were laid parallel to one another upon a smooth sur-
iace3 another set ol strips was laid upon these at right
angles, and the two layers were glued together by the gum
which exuded from the strips when they were moistened
with water. The layers were then hammered together into
a single sheet, called a plagula, which was exposed to the
sun to dry. The sheets were from 5 to 10 inches long, and
probably one sufficed tor an ordinary letter. Ii more space
was needed, several sheets were pasted together. The
center of the papyrus ·industry was Alexandria.

61. Ink (atramentum, or atramentum librarium) was or-
dinarily made irom the liquid oi the cuttle fish,⁴ or from a
composition ot soot and gum⁵ The inkstand (atramenta-
rium) was commonly cylindrical and often had two compart-
ments, one for black and one lor red ink. Pens (calami)
were made oi reeds grown chiefly in Egypt,⁶ and were kept
in a case (calamarium or theca calamaria) made usually oi
leather. The other articles which completed a writing outfit
were a piece ot lead (plumbum) and a ruler (regula) ior
