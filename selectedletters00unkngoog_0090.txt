8 CICERO'S LETTERS. [Ep. ΙΙ.

of him, see lntr. 54—scito, let availed himself of this privilegein

me inform you,· a favorite expres·
sion borrowed from colloquial
Latin, for introducing a bit of
news. Cf. the use of habeto and sic
habeto, Ep. XXVI. 1 n.-'l⁸erentia:
cf. Intr. 52.—abs te . . . ego,
nota word from voU in so long a
nme, solide I, etc. For abs te,

rejecting jurors who were likely to
vote for a conviction. If this viev
be correct, Clodius was really act-
ing in the interest of Catiline in
bringing the charge, since if Cati·
line were acquitted, he could nol
be put on trial again. This meth-
od of protecting criminals, called

cf. Ep. I. 4 n.-hoc tempore . . . praecoritano, became commones

cogitamus: it will never be cer-
tainly known whether Cicero did
defend Catiline in 65 uc. or not,
but this passage certainly indicates
such an intention on his part, and
there is no satisfactory reason for
believing that he did not carryout
his purpose. The fact that Cicero
believed in Catiline’s guilt (cf. Ep.
1. 1) would not, perhaps, have de·
terred him, as he in later years
undertook the defense of Vatinius
Gabinius, and C. Antonius, equally
notorious men, under still more
questionable circumstances, when
political considerations‚ as in this
ease, made it seem advisable. For
the arguments in support of the
opposite view, cf. Tyrrell, 12. pp.
8, 9.-sum1na accusatoris vo·
luntate: the charge was brought
by P. Clodius. The accuser had
the right of challenging perempto-
rily a certain number of jurors,
and the phrase quoted above
would indicate that Clodius had

in la'ter years (cf. Plin. Epist. 3.
p 33—35). The method to be
employed in securing an acquittal
for Catiline casts more of a shad-
ow upon Cicero’s honor than the
fact that he intended to undertake
or did undertake the defense.

ironical, although it is true that y
Atticus was intimate with many of j
the prominent men in Rome (cf.
