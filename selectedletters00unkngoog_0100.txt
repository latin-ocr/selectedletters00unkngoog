clemens lanista frugalissimum 'quemque secerneret, ut 1

runt. Non enim umquam turpior in ludo talario con-
sessus fuit: maculosi senatores, nudi equites, tribuni
non tam aerarii quam, ut appellantur, aerati ; pauci
tamen boni inerant, quos reiectione fugare ille non

voluntate, Ep. II. 1 n. -accusa-
tor: L. Lentulus Cras—lanista:

’ an owner and trainer of bands of

' gladiators. As the kind-hearted
lanista avoids 'sending his best
gladiators into encounters where
they will be sure to lose their
lives, so the defendant avoids
sending honest men into a jury-
box where they will lose their rep-
utation. For another explanation,
see Tyrrell. The correlation of ut
iacta est and ut primum. . .
consederunt would not be found
in careful prose- in ludo talario:
the vestis talaris reached to the
ankles‚ and was not worn by re-
spectable people (cf. Ge11.6.[7.]
12), and a ludus talarius was
probably an entertainment of a
low class where the performers
wore this garment3 cf. Fronto,
Ep. p. 160 Naber laudo censoris
illud,qui ludos talarius (effugeret),
quod semet ipsum diceret, cum ea
praeterisset, defficik dignitati ser-
vire, quin ad modum eratali aut
cymbali pedem poneret-macu-
losi: perhaps in its general sense,
perhaps with special reference to
men after whose names the censors
had placed a nota. — nudi, desti-
tute ; cf. inoptam, 2 n. -tribuni
. . . aerati: this is difficult to
understand. The common read-
iugis, non tam aerati . . . aera-
rii. The term aerarii was some-

times applied to citizens oi the
lowest clasS, outside the limits of
the centurias of the Servian con-
stitution, the ‘riffraff' of. the pop
ulation; and the phrase is under·
stood as meaning, ‘not so much
tribunes with money (aerati) as
tribunes without money or repu-
tation (aerarii).' The objections
to this explanation are that the

' point is obscure, and that in a list

of the three classes of people
composing the jury, where the
technical designations have been
used in two instances, we expect
to find the third term used, and
used in the technical sense, i.e. we ε
expect senatores . . . equites, tribuni '
nontam aerarii. The transposi-
tion by a copyist of aerarii (or
aerari, as the MS. really reads)
and aerati would not be unnatural. Ι
If we may adopt the reading non ἰ
tarn aerarii... aerati, the expres· ,
sion would mean ‘not so much ¹
tribunes who have money (for the ’
tribuni aerarii had money in
their charge) as tribunes who are 3
to be had for money (ceratii) l
This reading brings into relies the i
essential point, viz. the venality
of the judges. This conjecture i
was first put forward by Muretus ·
Cicero is quoting one of those
witticisms current in Rome which
are so frequent in his letters; ‘not
so much tribuni aerarii as, to
