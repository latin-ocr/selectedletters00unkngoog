Cicero took little part in politics during the years 55 and
54 rac„ and his letters exhibit his discouragement in regard
to them.⁸ They indicate, however, the growth of acordial
feeling between him and Caesar.⁴ Much os Cicero's atten-
tion was given to literature. To this period belong the
De Oratore, the De Re Publr'ca,⁶ and several speeches;

oi bribery and political intrigue,⁶ which had prevailed almost
uninterruptedly from midsummer of the year 54 u.c.,

between the followers of Clodius and Milo, which resulted

was elected sole consul on the 24th oi the intercalary month
ol this year.⁸ This sudden elevation to extraordinary power
completed the separation of Pompey from Caesar.

Several circumstances which occurred during the previous

death of Julia, Caesar’s daughter and Pompey’s wife, in 54

another family alliance with Caesar, severed a link which ·
had bound the two men together; buta still more important
lactor was the defeat and death of Crassus in the East in
5313.c.¹⁰ The indefinite continuance oi a triumvirate was
possible, but the existence ol a duumvirate was impossible,
