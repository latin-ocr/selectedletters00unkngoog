52. A fair knowledge ol the relations existing between
Cicero and his wile Terentia may be gained lrom the letters
ol Bk. 14, ad Fam„ all ol which are addressed to her. In
the early letters ol this correspondence written in 58 rac,
alter twenty years ol married lile, Cicero expresses himself
in most affectionate terms Alter this date, with the excep·
tion ol one letter in 50 rac, which is mainly upon business y
matters, there are no letters to Terentia up to 49 uc,
although this interval includes the period ol his procon- κ
sulship, when he wrote so many letters to his personal and i
political friends, Even the letters ol the year 49, when
Cicero was in so much anxiety‚ are very infrequent. The l
rest of the letters ol Bk. 14, belonging to the next two
years, are briei and formal. It appears that an estrange
ment gradually grew up between them which culminated
in their divorce in the early part ol 461³.c. In December 2
¹ ol the same year he married his rich ward Publilia¹; but
Publilia could not conceal her chagrin at finding hersell
second to Tullia in his affection, and when she evinced
joy a lew months later at Tullia's death, Cicero sent her to
her mother and could not be induced to receive her backv

into his lavor.²
