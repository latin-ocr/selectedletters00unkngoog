[Ep. V.

tis tuis, quae in Amaltheo posuisti, contenti erimus,
praesertim cum et Thyillus nos reliquerit et Archias
nihil de me scripserit, ac vereor ne, Lucullis quoniam
Graecum poema condidit, nunc ad Caecilianam fabulam

stulam Mallio dedi. Ad te ideo antea rarius scripsi,
quod non habebam idoneum cui darem, nec satis scie-
17 barn quo darem. Valde te venditavi. Cincius si

Cicero’s oration in support of Ar·
chias of the friendship existing

oi comedy was Caecilius Statius,
whom Cicero calls (Art. 7. 3. 10)

the manner of Caecilius (Statius)
upon the Caecilians.5

16. Antonio: C. Antonius, Cice·
ro's colleague in the consulship,
and now governor oi Macedonia,
a province which he had received
in retum for not supporting the
Catilinarians. Cicero had asked
Antonius to grant Atticus some
favor (Fam. 5. 5).- Mallio: per-
