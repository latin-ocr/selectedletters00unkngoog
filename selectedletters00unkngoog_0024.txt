xviii INTRODUCTION.

desire 'to link his own fortunes with those oi Pompey, led
Cicero to approve oi the Gabinian law,¹ and to lend his
active support to the Manilian law in 66 nc. In supporting
the latter measure Cicero delivered his first political speech,
and notwithstanding the united opposition of the OptimateS,
who appreciated the danger which threatened the oligarch·

power in the hands of a single man, the bill became a law.

a province,2 and devoted all his energy to his candidacy ior
the consulship. Cicero's political attitude underwent a
slight change in the two or three years preceding his con-
sulship. He had never been an out and out democrat, but
had· opposed the abuses oi the aristocratic system rather
than that system in its entirety. The subsidence of that
spirit of opposition which often characterizes youth, his
political ambitione, and the growth of a radical {action in
the democratic party with anarchical tendencies, all con-

' and his brother Quintus felt that the support of the sena-
torial party was essential, and that all suspicion oi a demo
cratic leaning on the part of Marcus must be removed, as is
indicated by a significant passage in a political pamphlet

which Quintus addressed to his brother at this time: Hi ³

only the nauus hamo, the prosecutor of Verres, and the

advocate of the Manilian law⁴3 but the revolutionary pur· ,
