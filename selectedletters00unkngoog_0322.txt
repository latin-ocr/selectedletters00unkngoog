Lxxxi. (am. 7- 24.) ·

M. CICERO S. D. M. FADIO GALLO.

1 Amoris quidem tuI, quoquo me verti, vestigia, vel
proxime de Tigellio; sensi enim ex litteris tuis valde
te laborasse. Amo igitur voluntatem. Sed paneade

’ re. Cipius, opinor, olim ‘Non omnibus dormio.’ Sic
ego non omnibus mi Galle, servio, Etsi quae est haec y
servitus? Olim, cum regnare existimabamur, non tam
ab ullis quam hoc tempore observor a familiarissimis
Caesaris omnibus praeter istum. Id ego in lucris pono,
non ferre hominem pestilentiorem patria sua; eumque
addictum iam tum puto esse Calvi Licini Hipponacteo .

LXXXI. Tusculum, abo ut 49. 2 (written about the same time
Aug. 20,4513.c. For Fadius, see as this letter), where, however.
Ep. IV. introd. note. the name of Cipius is omitted. - l

r. vestigia: sc. sunt. —vel, sor
instance—Tigellio: the singer
whom Horace dubs Sardus Tigel-
lius (Sat. i. 3. 3) from his birth-
place‚ Sardinia, a favorite of Julius
Caesar in Cicero’s time, and later
of Octavianus. Cf. Hor. Sat. r.2
and 3.—Cipius . . . dormio:
Cipius, as the story goes (cf. Fes-
tus), was in the habit ol feigning
sleep, but when on a certain
occasion a slave attempted to
steal one of his master’s cups,
Cipius started up, saying, ‘non
omnibus dormio) -— opinor: prob-
ably a case of genuine uncertainty
conceming the name, but cf. Hec-
tor Naevianus, Ep. XVIII. 7 n.-
olim, once upon a time.— sic . . .
servio: he may find it necessary
to be Caesar's slave, but he will
not be the slave of every one of
Caesar’s household. Cicero ap-
parently oses the same 'story in
the same connection in Art. 13.

oIIm: sc. before Caesar's assump ’
tlon ol power.—ab ullis: sc.
observabam from observor.·—a
familiarissimis: Gallus had evi·
dently expressed the tear that Ti-
gellius, who was angry at Cicero.
might use his influence with Cae-
sar against him. Cicero therefore
assures Gallus that there has been
no change in Caesar’s attitude to
blm. Cicero’s remark here har-
monizes with statements madea
year before; cf. Ep. LXI. 2.—

Ep. XVI. (end) n. — eumque . ..

Hipponactcan estimate put upon
him by Calvus Lt'cim'us.- Calvi
Licini: Gaius Licinius Macer Cal-
vus was known equally well as an
orator (cl, eg.. Cic. Brut. 280, 283}
and as a poet (cf, eg.. Sen. Contr.
7. 4. 7). The different tendencies
