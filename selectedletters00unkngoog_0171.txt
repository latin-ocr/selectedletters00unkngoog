Fam. 7. 5.] CICERO'S LETTERS. 89

quae ad meos pertinent. C. Trebatium cogitaram, quo-
cumque exirem, mecum ducere, ut eum meis omnibus
studiis beneficiis quam ornatissimum domum reducerem ;
sed posteaquam et Pompei commoratio diuturnior erat
quarn putaram, et mea quaedam tibi non ignota dubi-
tatio aut impedire profectionem meam videbatur aut
certe tardare, (vide quid mihi sumpserim !) coepi velle
ea Trebatium exspectare a te quae sperasset a me,
neque mercule minus ei prolixe de tua voluntate pro-
misi quam eram solitus de mea polliceri. Casus vero 2
mirificus quidam intervenit, quasi vel testis opinionis
meae vel sponsor humanitatis tuae. Nam cum de hoc
ipso Trebatio cum Balbo nostro loquerer accuratius

tus. Horace introduces him as
a speaker in Sar. 2. 1.

1. me alterurn: ci. Ep. XV. 7 n.
-quocumque exirem: Pompey
had named Cicero as one of his
¹5 legati on the corn commission
in 57 ac. (Ep. XV. 7), and Cicero
would naturally have gone to some
province in connection with that
matter, but as he preferred to stay'
at Rome, his place was taken by
Quintus, who went to Sardinia
(Ep. XVI. 7); or perhaps refer-
ence is made to the fact that the
province of Spain was assigned to
Pompey at the close oi his consul·
ship in 55 ΒΩ, and Cicero may
have been invited to aecompany
him as his legatus, but, as we
know, Pompey remained at Rome.
—dubitatim Cicero's hesitation
to leave Rome was due perhaps
partly to a sear 'that Clodius might
attack him during his absence, and

sar. The favor of the successful
governor of the Gauls would in·
sure to Trebatius what the friend·
ship of a legatur to Spain could
only make probable. — prolixe:
not infrequently in the Letters with
verbs of hoping, thinking, and.
promising, adverbs are used in·
stead of the neut. acc. plur. of the
adj. used substantively‚ ag. ut ipse
facile animadverterem male (for
mala) eum deme cogitare, Fam. 8,
12. .1; nan licuit diutius bene de ea
sperare, Fam. 10. 21. 1; si humani-
ter et sapienter et amabiliter in
me cogitare vis, Aa. 14. 1311. 2.
This is a colloquial usage. -pro-
misi: used οἱ a formal agree·
ment, while polliceri implies a
voluntary promise.

2. Balbo: L. Cornelius Balbus,
a native of Gades, who had re-
ceived Roman citizenship lor his
services against Sertorius ; cf. Cic.

partly to a fondness for Rome. Cf. pra Balbo, 5 i. He attached him-
sipotes,etc.,Ep.XVIl.2 n.-ex· seli closely to Caesar, and was
spectare. . . sperasset: in the often Caesar's confidential agent
contrast between these two words in Rome. We have three ol his
lies a delicate compliment to Cae· letters to Cicero, Ate. 9. 7 Α, 7 Β,
