84 CICERO’S LETTERS.

[Ep. XIX

equitatus in aliqua pugna? Quae popularem admiratio-
nem habuerunt‚ delectationem tibi nullam attulissent.
3 Quod si tu per eos dies operam dedisti Protogeni tuo,
dummodo is tibi quidvis potiusquam orationes meas
legerit, ne tu haud paulo 'plus quam quisquam nostrum
delectationis habuisti ; non enim te puto Graecos aut
Oscos ludos desiderasse, praesertim cum Oscos vel in
senatu vestro spectare possis, Graecos ita non ames ut
ne ad villam quidem tuam via Graeca ire soleas. Nam
quid ego te athletas putem desiderare, qui gladiatores
contempseris? In quibus ipse Pompeius comitetur se
et operam et oleum perdidisse. Reliquae sunt vena-

stage. Compare with thIs whole
passage the trenchant criticism
which Horace passes upon the
taste for realism and vulgar dis·
play upon the stage in his day
(Ep. 2. 1. 189-207).

ne, Ep. XVII. 2 n. - Graecos aut
Oscos ludos : comedy and tragedy
were essentially of Greek origin,
and Cicero speaks of them there-
fore as ludi Graeci in distinction
from the fabulae Atellanae (ludi
Osce), which were indigenous to
Italian soil. These Atellan larces
. were comic representations of life
with fixed characters. They were
cast in dialogue form, varied by
occasional songs. The action was
lively, and the language the vulgar
Latin. After the conquest of Cam-
pania, in 211 1³.c., these {arces were
introduced lnto Rome, given in
course of time a more distinetly
dramatic form, and used as alter-
’ pieces on the stage. Cf. Ep. LXI.

Ι. 207-217. — in senatu vestro:
Marius would seem to have been
a decurio, or member of the town

council, probably in Pompeii, and
in the deliberations of his Oscau
colleagues upon petty matters of
town govemment, he could find all
the elements of an ‘Oscan bur-
lesque' without taking the trouble
to come to Rome for them. —via
Graeca: perhaps a road leading
to his villa which Marius did not
use; but the point of the jest is
obscure to us. - athletas: a term
applied properly to those who took
part in the five contests - running,
wrestling, boxing, the pentathlum
(made up of live distinct gamas),
the pancratium (boxing and wres·
tling). As we may infer from the
text, ln quibus, etc, the Roman
people showed little enthusiasm

for these Greek ,- mes, and this
continued to be . case until
they gained an artific. stimulus
by receiving the approv.. l cer-

tain emperors. Nero in parlffllar
was very fond of them (Taentnn-
¹4· 20). - gladiatores: on (3ξο-
ero's own distaste for gladiawssffl
contests, cf. An. 2. ι. 1 Kal. Imm
