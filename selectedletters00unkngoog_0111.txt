the reading is correct, perhaps except during Cicero's consul-
Bdckel’s explanation is the most ship and his candidacy for that

plausible one. The mimus (a kind
of farce) was a popular form of
entertainment. One of these farces
well known at Rome was called
the Faba Mimas. Both here
and in the other passage (Seneca,
Ἀποκολοκύντωσις, 9) where the ex-
pression occurs, the writer is speak-
ing on the subject of an apotheo-
sis. Now the Pythagoreans were
the most prominent teachers of
reincamation, and at the same
time laid down certain rules in re
gard to the use of beans as an
article of diet. The Faba Mimas
may therefore have been a parody
on the teachings of Pythagoras
upon these two points, and well
known for its wit or nonsense, so
that the meaning of the passage¹
may be, ‘if Afranius is elected

office, held aloof from politics,

ings of his school, the Epicurean.
