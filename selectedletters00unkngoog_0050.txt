xliv INTRODUCTION.

47. ln his financial dealings Cicero was honorable and Ἴ
high-minded. He declined to make money, as even his J
friends Atticus and M. Brutus did, by loauing money at
usurious rates. His upright management of Cilicia was in
marked coutrast to the almost universal practices of his
contemporaries. He paid his debts conscientiously, although
not always with promptness, because of his frequent financial
embarrassment. In some other points Cicero does not
show as strict a sense of honor: he did not scruple to open
certain letters from his brother Quintus to a third person,
which fell into his hands, and which, a's he suspected,
contained slanderous statements in regard to himself¹; he
dictated to the secretary of Atticus a letter ⁴iu praise of
Caelius and then read it to Caelius as an authentic epistle
from Atticus²; in another letter he even speculates upon ,
the feasibility of disavowing an oration which had offended

- Curio.3 The question of ethics involved in the defense of

Catiline scarcely belongs here and hasbeen discussed else
where.⁴ It should be remembered in partial extenuation of
these facts that the code of honor in such matters was not
so strict in Cicero's day as it is in our own, and that
his lot was cast in times when life and fortune hung by a
slender thread.

48. Cicero’s enthusiastic study of Greek and Latin
literature at Rome, and later at Athens and Rhodes, has
already been noted (if 1, 2). These habits of study con-
tinued throughout his life, and gave him such a fund of Ι
general information as few of his contemporaries possessed.
Still he was not a man of profound learning, even in his
chosen profession. He was rather a man of cultivated tastes

- and broad sympathies. Of his knowledge of the literature,

history, and antiquities of Greece and Rome, his letters,
