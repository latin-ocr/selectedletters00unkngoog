SERVIVS CICERONI SALVTEM PLVRIBVS VERBIS.

Etsi scio non iucundissimum me nuntium vobis1
adlaturum, tamen, quoniam casus et natura in nobis
dominatur, visum est iaciendum, quoquo modo res se
haberet, vos certiores facere. A. d. x K. Iun, curn ab
Epidauro Piraeum navi advectus essem, ibi M. Mar-
cellum collegam nostrum conveni eumque diem ibi
consumpsi ut cum eo essem. Postero die ab eo di-
gressus sum eo consilio, ut ab Athenis in Boeotiam
irem reliquamque iurisdictionem absolverem, ille, ut
aiebat, supra Maleas in Italiam versus navigaturus
erat. Post diem tertium eius diei, cum ab Athenis2
proficisci inanimo haberem, circiter hora decima noc-
tis P. Postumius familiaris eius ad me venit et mihi
nuntiavit M. Marcellum collegam nostrum post cenae

LXXVIII. Athens, May 31,
45 nc. M. Claudius Marcellus,
the consul of 51 ne, who had
been living in banishment at Myti-
lene since the battle of Pharsalus,
was recalled by the senate, with
the consent of Caesar, towards
the close of the year 46. The
indifference which he felt concern-
ing his recall is shown both by the
coldness and brevity ol his letter
ol acknowledgment to Cicero
(Fam. 4. 11), and by the fact that
he did not set out for Rome until
the middle of 45 Ine. On his
way thither he was murdered at
the Piraeus, as described in this
letter, the style oi which is terse
andgraphic.

1. non iucundissimum: in-
stances of litotes are common in
the letters3 cf. non minimum,

nan pessimam, nan mediocriter,
etc-visum est faciendum:
Landgraf, p. 327, notes that facere
at is a colloquial expression (cf.
bam. 10. 17. 3), while facere fol-
lowed by the infin, as here, be-
longs to vulgar Latin ; cf. Petron.
51 fecit Caesarem reporrigere.-
navi: the regular form in early
Latin. Nave appears first in Cic·
ero’s time. From Livy on nave
is the common form. -collegam
nostrum: probably in the augu-
rate. -— ab Athenis: cf. ab Aegina,
Ep. LXXV. 4 n. Cf. also ab Epi-
dauro, above, and ab Athenis, 2. —
reliquam. . . absolverem: be-
iore leaving his province he held
the circuit courts, which it was
part of a governor’s duty to do.—
supra Maleas: super is the com-
mon preposition in this sense.
