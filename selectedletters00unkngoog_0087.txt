Cicero's dilemma is therefore a .

serious one. If he accedes to the
request ol Caecilius, and appears
against Satyrus, he will antagonize
Satyrus and the latter’s friend
Domitius, who are at present very
friendly to him and would be of
great service to him politically. If
he declines to accommodate Cae·
cilius, he will offend the crabbed
old gentleman and Atticus in some
degree, and perhaps jeopardize the
thances of Atticus lor his uncle's

on the part ol the purchaser of

— magistrum (sc. auctionis): the

general management of such a sale
was in the hands of a magister auc-

legal representative of the owner.
