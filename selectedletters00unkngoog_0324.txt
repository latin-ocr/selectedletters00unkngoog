CICERO’S LETTERS.

[Ep. Lxxxn l

- LXXXII. (Fam. 7. 25.)

CICERO S. D. M. FADIO GALLO.

1 Quod epistulam conscissam doles, noli laborare, salva
est; domo peteS, cum libebit. Quod autem me mones,
valde gratum est, idque ut semper iacias rogo ; videris
enlm mihi vereri ne, si istum ludibrio habuerImuS,
rideamus γέλωτα σαρδάνιον. Sed heus tu,·manum de
tabula! magister adest citius quam putaramus; vereor

Caesar and Cicero’s iear of Cae-
sar’s anger prevented Cicero from
maintaining long the manly posi·
. tlon which he assumes in this 'and
the·f0110wing letter, for about a
month later he writes to Atticus:
miror te nihildum cum ragalim
velut hoc ipsum quantum accepe-
rit, prorsus aveo scire nec tamen
flocci facio (Att. 13. 50. 3); and
about the same time: Tigellium
totum mihi (sc. reduc in gratiam)
ct quidem quam primum nam
pendeo animi (Att. 13. 51. 2). Cf.
Schmidt, Briefm. pp. 353 ff.

LXXXII. Tusculum, about
Aug. 24, 45 ac.

1. quod... salva est: appar-
ently Gallus had destroyed Ep.
LXXXI. after reading it, for sear
that it might fall into the hands
of Tigellius or of his friends.
Cicero seems to assure Gallus,
however, that he has preserveda
copy—quod, etc: cf. Intr. 91
and Fam. 7. 32, 33.—m0nes:
sc. ut cautior sim. —istum z ie. Ti-
gellius. -γέλωτα σαρδάνιονε a
bitter laugh of anger or secret
triumph. But perhaps we should

. read, with Ernesti, σαρδόνιον. Σαρ-
δόνιον was a poisonous plant of
Sardinia, which caused death when
eaten, and which so distorted the
faces oi those who ate it that

they se'emed to be laughing. The
jest would then bein harmony
with the sneers at the Sardinian
origIn of Tigellius in the' previous
letter-heus tu: cf. Ep. XXXV.
25 n.- manum de tabula: sc.
tolle. The schoolmaster (Caesar)
has been away (in Spain), but sud·
denly· returns, and those under,
him (like Cicero and Gallus) hadl
better stop the pranks they hare
been playing in his absence, or
they will suffer ior it (cf. in Ca-
tonium Catoninos). Cicero is
probably thinkIng of a roomlul
ol schoolboys, who, instead ol
giving their attention to the task
set them, have arnused themselves
during the master’s absence by
scribbling upon their tabulae. The
master suddenly appears, and the
order comes manum de tabula
(tollite). The scribbling thch
Cicero and Gallus have been
guilty of during Caesar’s absence,
is 'in writing political biographies
of Cato. Cf. Catonem tuum, Ep.
LXXXI. 2 n. Or the reference
may be general: ‘No more indis-
cretions.' Cf. Otto, Sprz'chwdrter,
210.—citiusquam putaramus:
