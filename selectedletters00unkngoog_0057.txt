57. Tiro, the slave and freedman, deserves a place
among the members oi Cicero’s family because oi the
intimate terms upon which he lived with all the members
ol it. He was hismaster’s secretary and accompanied him
wherever he went. Cicero's affection lor him is evident
hom the letters of Bk. 16, ad Fam, most ot which are
letters written to Tiro by Cicero. He was a man ot
cultivation, and his criticism was ol great service to CicerO,
who writes to him: tu, qui κανὼν esse meorum scrzptorum
solea.1 He did some independent literary work in writing a
lile ol his patron,2 in making a collection ol his witticisms,⁸
and in editing a collection ol stenographical abbreviations.
He apparently wrote some tragedies also⁴

58. Atticus was born in 109 nef and spent his early lile
at Rome3 but the dreadlul events which attended the war
between Marius and Sulla led him to withdraw from Rome
in 86 rac. and take up his residence at Athens⁸ where
Cicero made his acquaintance about 79 ne. His father
left him 2,ooo,ooo sesterces, and his uncle Q. Caecilius
10,ooo,000⁷ more'. This property he found means ol
increasing by judicious investments, as he managed the
business affairs of Cato, Hortensius, Cice10,and others‚⁸
made loans to individuals and towns,⁹ carried on the
business of a publisher,¹⁰ and even kept trained bands oi
