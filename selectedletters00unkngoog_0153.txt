dius saw the advantage to be
derived from such bodies, and re·
organized them in 58 lac. Under
his control they played a part in
politics not unlike that of the po-
litical clubs in France before the
Revolution. The decuriati were
rnen organized into decure'ae or
groups, in this case for political
purposes; cf. pra Sest. 34.—que

Cf. Ep. V. 2n. Such organiza-
tions were not effectually con-
trolled until under Julius Caesar’s

not been preserved. - Cn. Domi·
tium (Calm'num): he supported in
later years the cause of Caesar in
the Civil War. The last reference
to him is in connection with an un·
successful campaign against Phar·
naces in 47 rac. (Bell. Alex. 65).

ac, after many delays a proposi-
tion to recall Cicero from exile
was laid before the people; but as
Clodius had already filled the
carnitium and the curia with armed
men, a riot followed, in which
Sestius was seriously wounded.
The forces of Cicero’s friends had
taken up their position at the tem-
ple of Castor, on the south side
of the Forum; cf. pra Sest. 7 5 f.

pave the way for the oration in
his behalf, which was delivered a
