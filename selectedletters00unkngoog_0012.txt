vi PREFACE.

the Epistulae aul Atticum is that oi Ο. E Schmidt. For further
particulars the reader may consult the Introduction and the
statement in the Critical Appendin ’

The orthography has been, in general, conformed to the
standards established by Brambach and by Georges in his
chikon der lateinischen Worfformcn.

In the Introduction arrd the Commentary attention has been
directed in particular to the characteristics of epistolary and
colloquial Latin. A full discussion oi these peculiarities would
have far transcended the limits oi this boolc The editor has
therefore contented himself with a statement in the Introduc-
tion oi the most important divergencies which the Letters show
in lexicography‚ syntax, and style from the standard in those
matters in formal Latin, and has supplemented this general

statement by more detailed notes at the proper points in the

Commentary.

The works which the editor has found of most service inthe ,
preparation oi the Introduction and Commentary are men·
tioned in the list given on a subsequent page, and although his
indebtedness is usually noted specifically in the Commentary,
he ieels under special obligation to the editions of Tyrrell‚ χ
Watson‚ Slipfle-Bdckeh and Hoimann-Andresen‚ and to the
writings of Ο. E. Schmidt and Landgraf.

But, above all, the editor would gratefully aclrnowledge the
deep obligation which he is under to Professors C. L. Smith
and Tracy Peck, the editors-in-chiei oi this Series, for the care l
iul criticism which they have given to this worlr while it has
been passing through the press. F· F· A·
