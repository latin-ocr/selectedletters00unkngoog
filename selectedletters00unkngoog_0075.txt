perspecta habes (Lepidus Fam. 10. 34. 4), this combination
is not strictly synonymous with the perfect. Cf. note to

T lie Adverb. ⁸

85. (a) One of the most noticeable characteristics in the
syntax of the Letters consists in the use of the adverb
with asse. This usage is frequent in colloquial Latin ol
all periods. It is commonly found with adverbs ot place
(pram, praesta, procul, etc), and the general and particular
adverbs of manner (ito, cantra, aliter, banc, recte, tata, etc.) ς
e.g.‚ sit modo recte in Hispaniis (Art. 10. 12a. 2) ς sed quidvis
est melius quam sic asse ut sumus (Fam. 16. 12. 4). lu this
construction esse is something more than a simple copula.

(b) More rarely, but in a few clear cases, the adverb is
used in place of an attributive adjective; eg. meaa ullae
privatim iniuriae (Lentulus, Fam. 12. 14. 3). Cf. also note
to circumcirca, Epist. LXXV. 4, and to sic, Epist. V. 3.

Parataxis.

86. The LetterS, in common with other literary com-
positione which affect the sermo cotidianus, admit the
paratactical arrangement more treely than formal Latin
does. This fact is evident (1) in the use of coordination
rather than subordination ; eg. liam ergo plagam affiagipar
duos superiores Marcellarum consulatus, cum est actum de pra
vincia Caesaris, nanc incida in discrimen ipsum (Aa. 7. 1. 5),
lorcam ffagissam, etc.; (a) in the paratactical use of the·
subjunctive in certain common formulae, eg. sac diligas
(Art. 3. r 3. 2) 3 (3) in the parenthetical use of certain verbs
Ol thinking, eg. sed, opinor, quiescamus (Aa. 9. 6. 2);
