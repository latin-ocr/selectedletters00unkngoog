Turum.

53. Tullia, Cicero’s only daughter, was probably born in
79 or 78116. In 66110. she was betrothed to C. Calpurnius
Piso Frugi,¹ and married him sometime within the next
three years. He died during the year oi Cicero's exile.²
ln 56 ne. Tullia married Furius Crassipes.⁸ The match
was regarded as a good one, but for reasons unknown to
us Crassipes and Tullia were soon divorced. Her next
matrimonial venture was with P. Cornelius Dolabella* the
Caesarian politician. Their married lile proved to bea
most unhappy one, and they were probably divorced towards
the close of the year 46 n.c.⁵ Tullia herself died in Feb,
45 nc? and her lather was plunged in the deepest grief, in
which his friends Caesar, Lucceius, Sulpicius, and others
sought to comfort him by letters ot condolence.⁷

Mnncus Turnus Crcnno rrrrus.

54. Cicero’s only son Marcus was born in 65 nc. The
father gave his personal attention ior some time to the
young man’s education, and sent him later to Atheus to
pursue his studies, in the hope that he would take up
the legal profession3 but the young man's tastes were
averse to study, and the appearance ol Brutus at Athens,
in 44 nc, was enough to cause his enlistment in the
army ol the liberatores, in which he served with distinction.⁸
He espoused the cause of Octavius against Antony, was
made consul by the former in 30 a.c.‚⁹ and is last heard ol
as proconsul of Asia.
