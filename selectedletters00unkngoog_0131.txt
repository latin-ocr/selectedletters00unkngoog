CICERO’S LETTERS. 49

discessimus; adlata est enim nobis rogatio de pernicie
mea, in qua quod correctum esse audieramus erat eius-
modi, ut mihi ultra quadringenta milia liceret esse, illo
pervenire non liceret. Statim iter Brundisium versus-
contuli ante diem rogationis ne et Sica, apud quem
eram, periret et quod Melitae esse non licebat. Nunc

patriotism. It is only when two
such epochs in Cicero’s life are
placed side by side that the reader
can discover the true key to his
character, which is to be found in
the fact that he was peculiarly sen-
sitive to his surroundingsand was
exalted or depressed by circum-
stances which would have had no
abiding influence upon a more
phlegmatic nature (cf. Intr. 50).

Without waiting to see what ac-
tion would be taken upon the bill

him by name (qui civem Romanum
indemnatum interemisset, ei aqua

friend Sica, near Vibo. Here news
reached him of the amended bill
directed against him personally.
He therefore hastily left Vibo for
ITarentum and Brundisium. See

The rogatio in this case read as
follows: velitis iubeatis ut M.

Cf· Cic. de Domo, 47.- correctum:
the amended bill forbade Cicero
to remain at any point within 4⁰0
miles of Italy. After a bill had
been brought forward an interval
of 17 days, a trinundinum (cf.

Herzog, 1. 1092, n. 23 see, how-
ever, Momm. St. R. III. 376, n. r)
was allowed to elapse before a
vote was taken upon it, during
which time it could be modified.

carelessly used for et ne, as the
force of ne does not extend to
the second of the two correlative
clauses. — ne . . . periret: those
who should harbor an exile within
the prescribed limits made them-
selves liable to a severe penalty.
- Melitae: Malta was within the
4oomile limit.—mi Pomponi:
Cicero rarely addresses his corre·

the 397 letters to Atticus, Atticus
is·addressed by name only 28
times: mi Attice nlneteen times,

letter. The omission of the prae·
