With local differences in familiar speech and with those
which time effects, the student who confines his attention η
to¹ Cicero’s correspondence is not concerned, as the letters «
fall within a period oi twenty-five yearS, and were written ,η
by men who spoke Latin as 'it was spoken in the city ol ·.
Rome. The other factors are of interestg &One cannot fail '
to notice the freedom and informality with which Cicero*
writes to his friend Atticus or his brother Quintus, as com-'

persons that we find the greatest divergence from formal κ
