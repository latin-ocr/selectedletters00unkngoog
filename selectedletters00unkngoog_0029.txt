15. Clodius skilfully prepared the way for an attach upon
Cicero by securing the passage of certain popular mensures,
and, having gained the support of the consuls A. Gabinius
and L. Piso, between Mar. 20 and 25, 58 e.c.,¹ he secured the
adoption ola blll enacting: qui civem Romanum indemnatum
interemisset, ei aqua et igni interdiceretur.² The principle of
this bill was not new, and no one was mentioned in it by
name, but Cicero knew that it was directed against himself.
There can be little doubt that, in view of the Porcian and
Sempronian lawe, the execution oi Lentulus and his fellow-
conspiratorS, who were not allowed to make an appeal to the
people‚ was unconstitutional. Cicero's plea, that the passage
of the senatus consultum ultimum suspended this privilege,
and that Lentulus and the others, by conspiring with the
Allobroges, had lost their right as citizens, is not a sufficient
. answer. At all events, Cicero’s cause was a hopeless one.
The senators and knights were powerless the consuls would
give no help, and the triumvirs were not loath to have Cicero

' and Cato, who was at this time sent to Cyprus on a difficult

mission, removed from the city before Caesar's departure.

16. This state of things had induced Cicero to withdraw
from the city before the law of Clodius was passed, and
soon after his departure the latter promulgated another
proposition in the following form: velites iubeatis ut M. Tullio
aqua et agni ahterdietum αἵθ This bill, with the subsequent
modification that the interdiction should hold good within
a limit of 400 miles4 was adopted about Apr. πο.ε Cicero's
