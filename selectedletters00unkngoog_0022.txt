philosophy and oratory. Cicero's study of philosophy
during this period determined his subsequent philosophica}
attitude, while his work under Molon of Rhodes enabled
him to cultivate a less florid style of oratory than that which ,
characterized his earlier orations. At Athens he also made
the acquaintance of T. Pomponius Atticus.1

3. Cicero's marriage to Terentia, a woman of some prop
erty and of good family, must have taken place soon after l
his return to Rome, or just before his departure from the
city.² Two years after his return, in 76 nc, he was quaestor,
and had charge of Western Sicily, with Lilybaeum as his y
, headquarters. His achievements in Sicily made little im·

pression at Rome,3 but the intimate acquaintance which he l
gained with the island and its people served him in good
stead when he made his first real appearance in politics Ῐ
six years later as the prosecutor of Verres.

Verres who had been governor of Sicily from 73 to
71 rac, was charged by the Siciliane with extortion andy
cruelty. Cicero, who conducted the prosecution, presented l
the facts in such a masterly way that Hortensius, the advo
cate of Verres, withdraw from the case, and Verres himself
went into erile.4

4. His prosecution of Verres as wellas his defense of
¹Roscius Amerinus (80 ue.) and of Cornelius Sulla (in 62 ac.)
have caused much discussion of Cicero's political tendencies
during this early period. All three of these cases had a
pronounced political character, and in all three Cicero was
the advocate of democratic interests. He defended Ros·'
cius against the attacks of Sulla's favorite‚ during the
lifetime of that champion of the aristocratic cause. He

prosecuted Verres without mercy, although Verres was
