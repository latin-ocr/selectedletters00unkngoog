cf. lntr. 99. — mense Se'ptembri:
the ludi Magni or Romani began
Sept. 4 and lasted 15 days, and
later in the year came the ludi
plebeii, the Saturnalia, etc, so
that little legal business could be
done between Sept. 1 and Jan. 1.—
legati: the reference is to alegatio
¹ libera, an unofficial embassy. Sen-
ators favored with such a privilege
could travel for their own pleasure
or profit with the title and the
rights of a legatus, and receive
supplies from government agents
without performing any official du-
ties. The provinces found this
senatorial junketing such a bur-
den that Cicero in his consulship
placed certain limitations upon it.
-Pisonem proconsul in Gallia

tocracy were probably at this mo
ment little inclined to support
Cicero’s candidacy, and voted for
him the next year only because he
was the candidate most likely to
defeat Catiline and the democrats.
-his .. . competitoribus, pro
vtiled that civilions are my only
rivols,¹ for if some one returns ³
from a successful military cam-
paign to stand for the consulship,
the result will be more uncertain.
—manumt the support ot Pom-
pey. By the provisions of the
Manilian law, Pompey had the
year before been given charge of
the war against Mithridates Cice·
ro’s advocacy of that bill would
naturally secure for him Pompey's
support in the consular electiori.
Atticus, who was at this time in
Athens, and therefore nearer than
Cicero to Pompey, was asked
to make sure of Pompey’s assist-
ance; or, perhaps, as Tyrrell thinks,
manum refers to the followers of
Pompey, some of whom might
return to Rome in time for the
election.
