INTRODUC'IION. lxv

frequentative, and in the expressions just noted we have an
illustration of the colloquial fondness for unduly emphasiz·
ing a fact.

80. ¹ Irfybrids. A few hybrids are found in the Letters, but
apparently only in the more familiar letters to Atticus, eg.
Pseudocato, 'Ate 1. 14. 63 toculli0‚ Att. 2. 1. 123 sacteon,
Att. 1. 16.13.

81. Archaism. As was remarked above, colloquial Latin
was conservative in retaining certain forms and expressions
which became obsolete in formal Latin. Instances in point
are dicier, an obsolete infinitive form (vatin, Fam. 5. 9. ι),
isto=istuc (Cael, Fam. 8. 15. 2 et possim), illi=illic
(Cael, Fam. 8. 15. 2), qui (abl.) (Fam. 2. 16. 2), ast=at
(Art. 1. 16. 173 3. 15. 6), and absquc=sine(Att. 1.19.1).
These forms, as might be expected, are more frequent in the
l'etters of the less cultivated or more colloquial of Cicero’s
correspondents. They are very rarely found in Cicero’s
own letters, Cf. note to isto, Epist. XLVIII. 2, and espe-
cially to mi, Epist. XCIII. 2.

82. Contracted Forms. Of most interest in this connection .
is the occurrence in the tenses of the perfect system of syn-
copated forms 'thch are used far more freely in epistolary
than in formal Latin. In fact, the comparative frequency of
such forms in a letter seems to depend upon its informality.
In the seventeen letters from Caelius (Bk. 8, ad Fam.)‚
which are very familiar in their tone, syncopation takes place
in the perfect tenses fifty-five times, while full forms occur
but four times. Typical examples from the Letters are con-
suesti (Caecina‚ Fam. 6. 7. 6), pugnarunt (Cael.‚Fam. 8. 11. 2),
peccasse (Q. Cic„ Fam. 16. 26. 1), and decreram (Plancus, Fam.
10. 21. 2). About half of the 140 syncopated verb forms
which occur in the letters addressed to Cicero belong to the
first conjugation. Cf. also notes to detersa, Epist. XIX. 2,.
commas, Epist. xcvrn. 1, and Ravenndest Epist. xxxr. 4
