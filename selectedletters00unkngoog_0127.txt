omnia, si te habeh0. Multa per Varronem nostrum
agi possunt, quae te urgente erunt firmiora, multa ab
ipso Publio elici, multa cognosci, quae tibi occulta esse
non poterunt, multa etiam —sed absurdum est singula
explicare, cum ego requiram te ad omnia. Vnum illud 5
tihi persuadeas velim, omnia mihi fore explicata, si te
videro; sed totum est in e0, si ante quam ille ineat
magistratum. Puto Pompeium Crasso urgente, si tu
aderis, qui per Βοῶπιν ex ipso intellegere possis qua
fide ab illis agatur, nos aut sine molestia aut certe sine
errore futuros Precibus nostris et cohortatione non
indiges. Quid mea voluntas, quid tempuS, quid rei

quam me ipsiem.- Varronem:
ci. intr. to Ep. LX. Varro was an
intimate friend of Pompey, and
{ould therefore be of service to
icero.

5. si te videro ι protases of the
luture form often stand in the
oratio obliqua in the indicative to
indicate the time relation solely
(Bockel). Cf. also Intr. 8411.-

stratum: Clodius would become
tribune in December. — puto
Pompeium, eto: ‘I think that
ilyou are here, while Crassus is
urging Pompey on, you, who can
find out from the prime mover
himself through her of the ox-
eyes, with how much sincerity the
triumvirs are acting, I think, I say,
that we shall be either free from
annoyanee or at least from mis-
conceptions.’— Crasso urgente:
the dislike which Crassus felt for
Cicero seems to date from 66 nc,
when Cicero, in his speech for the
llanilIan law, by exaggerating the
part which Pompey had playerl in
certain matterS, had belittled the

achievements of Crassus. An ap

parent, not a real, reconciliation ’

took place in the senate in 61 nc.
(cf. Ep. V. 5 n; XIII. 2). Another
open quarrel between the two men
occurred in 54 B.c.; cf. Fam. 1.
9. 20.-Boemv: Clodia, the sis·
ter of Clodius. This epithet of
Hera as applied to her has a
double meaning. On the one hand,
as with Hera, the brilliancy of
Clodia’s eyes was one of her claims
to heauty. Cicero speaks of her
flagrantia oculorum, pro Cael. 49.
On the other hand, her will was
imperious, and her fondness to

control men and things as well 1

marked as was that of Hera. She
was the LesbIa of the poet Catul-
lus, and the mistress of the young
orator Caelius, by whom the let·
ters of Bk. 8, ad Fam. were written.
For a sketch of her life, ef. Bois-
sier, Cice‘ron et scs Amis, 174-186.
Cf. also Merrill's Catullus, Intr.
18 ff. She hated Cicero, and
knew and sympathized with her
brother's pians against him. Ap·
parently Atticus was one of her
friends.
