athread was wound about the middle of it and sometimes
passed through the papyrus itseli‚ and a seal was attached
to the ends of the string.² The seal was the guarantee of
genuineness; s0‚ for instance, upon one occasion, when
Cicero had opened some letters from Quintus to certain
hiends‚ on the suspicion that they contained slanderous
remarks about himself, he was not afraid of the consequences,
because Pomponia, the wile of Quintus, who was not on
good terms with her husband, had her husband's seal and
would not object to sealing the letters again.⁸ The seal
often had for its design the likeness oi the owner⁴ or of
one ol his ancestors⁵ Wax was commonly used to receive
the impression, but sometimes Asiatic chalk.⁰ Upon the
outside ol the roll the name of the person addressed was
written in the dative, sometimes with his title and the place
where he could be found, eg. M. Lucretio flamini Martis
ammoni l'ompeiis.⁷
