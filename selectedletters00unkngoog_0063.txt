was written in 68 B.C.; the latest (Fam. 10. 24), a letter from
Plancus to Cicer0‚ bears the date of July 28, 43 ac. Cicero's

the circumstance that the attitude of Octavius changed in

the summer of 43 ae, and Cicero's letters aiter that date
were not published because of the strictures they contained
