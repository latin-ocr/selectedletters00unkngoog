INTRODUCTION. lxxv

by which Cicero commonly introduces proverbial expres·
sions and popular sayings in formal composition. In-
stances of popular expressions are dno parietes a'e eadem
fidelia dealbare (Curius, Fam. 7. 29. 2); sus Mrmrwam
[docet] (Fam. 9. 18. 3) ; pr'ctus et politus (Aa. 2. 21. 4);
sciens prudensque (Cael, Fam. 8. 16. 5).

103. Play upon Wards, etc. In the same connection men-
tion may be made of the fondness which Cicero and some
ol his correspondents show for playing upon words in their
familiar letters. lllustratioris are in istic te Hateriano iure
[jurisprudence] delectas, ego me hic Hirtiano [iura ‘sauce ']
(Fam. 9. 18. 3) ; tu, qai ceteris cavere drilr'cisti, in Britannia ne
ab essedariis decorians caveto, ‘you who have learned how to
draw up securities for others, look out for your own security
-and don’t be taken in by the essedarii’ (Fam. 7. 6. 2).
Cicero's letters to his legal friend Trebatius (Fam. Bk. 7)
are full of legal puns. Other good instances of similar witti-
cisms are to be found in Art. 1. 16. 10 and in the letters
to Paetus (Fam. Bk. 9). Cf. also notes to honoris eausa,
Epist. XIX. 2, and occidione occisum, XXXIV. 7. Cicero
had a great reputation for wit of this sort (cf. Fam. 9. 16. 4),
and after his death his secretary Tiro edited his witty say-
ings. Cf. Quint. 6. 3. 5 ς Macrob. Sat. 2. 1. 12.

104. In conclusion it may be noted that in his discussion
of public and private affairs of a delicate character, Cicero
often considered it discreet to express himself in language
which would be unintelligible to every one save the person
for whom the letter in question was intended. As he him-
self puts it in one case : sed lraec scripsi properans et melier-
culr timida· posthae ad te ant, si perfidelem habebo cni dem,
scribam plane omnr'a ant, si adserere scribam, tn tamen intelle-
ἕω,- in iis epistulis ma Laelium, te F arium faciam ; cetera erant
ἐν αἰνιγμοῖς (Aer. 2. 19. 5). As a result of this policy there
ate some puzzling passages in the Letters which still frus-
