xxii INTRODUCTION.

lus and the Optimates, Caesar secured the passage ot an
agrarian law¹ and bills ratifying Pompey's arrangements in
the East,² while the people, under the leadership of the
tribune P. Vatinius, approved a bill assigning to Caesar,
from Mar. 1, 59 ue, the provinces ot Cisalpine Gaul and
Illyricum, with an army ol three legions for five years, to
whichthe senate, apparently of its own motion, added
Transalpine Gaul and a fourth legion³ ’
14. After the return of Caesar, Cicero took little part in
politics. He did not sympathize with the uncompromising
attitude of the senate, he was hurt by the coldness of
Pompey towards himself, and disappointed by that leader's
selfish aims. While appreciating the irresistible power ot
the Triumvirate, he saw a ray ot hope in the apparent
unpopularity ol the triumvirs,⁴ whose rule, he believed,
could not last long. Clodius continued straight on toward
his cherished purpose ol avenging himself upon Cicero
With that end in view he caused himself to be adopted
by a plebeian, Fonteius, and secured an election as tribune 'l
for the year 58.
Cicero would seem to have been blind to his own danger. “
He knew ot the enmity of Clodius, but did not tear him, so
that he made no opposition to his adoption or his election,
. and as late as Nov, 59 uc, writes in a confident way ot
the future.⁶ The conduct of Caesar, who appreciated
Cicero's danger, was most genereus, He offered Cicero
the position of legatus in Gaul⁶ This offer, however, Cicero
declined, as well as that of a legatio libero,⁸ and a position

on the commission to divide the public land in Campania!
