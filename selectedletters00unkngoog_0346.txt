1. nihil sibi longius fuisse:
tle. ‘nothing was more desired by
him.’ This is the meaning of the

comrades, with the hope of per-

out of pure friendship and admira-
tion. When Caesar was killed,
therefore, he found no common
point of sympathy either with
those who rejoiced in the death of
a tyraut, as did Cicero, or with
those who used Caesar’s name to
conjure with, as did Antony. His
grief at Caesar's death and his
superintendence of the public
games in his name called forth
unfriendly criticism from Cicero.
The sorrow of Matius upon hear-
ing this fact was disclosed to
Cicero by their common friend
Trebatius (cf. Ep. XXI. introd.
note), who had' made the ac-

phrase when followed by quam ut
or quom dum, but when followed
by quam with the infin. it means
‘nothing is more tiresome.' Cf.
Antibarbarus s. v. longus. —que· l

entered public life. - congluti-

word is frequent in Cicero.
