The first step of the triumvirs was to remove their
enemies at Rome, and Cicero’s name was included in the
list of the proscribed‚ notwithstanding the protest of
Octavius. Cicero at first thought of seeking refuge in the
East, and actually set sail from Astura for that purpose, but
the unfavorahle weather and his own unwillingness to leave
his native land held him back, and the emissaries of Antony
found him still in his Formian villa when they' reached that
place, Dec. 7. His faithful slaves attempted to save him
even at the last moment by hurrying him on board a ship
which lay in the harhor, but he was overtaken by his pur-
suem, and, forbidding his followers to make resistance, gave
himself up t0 death at the hands of his assassins.¹

THE PRIVATE mu ΟΕ CICERO.

45. Cicero's father was in moderate circumstances and
from him Cicero inherited the family estate at Arpinum and
’ a house in the Carinae. The dower of his wife Terentia
amounted to 480‚000 sesterces,2 but the larger part of his
income was derived from legacies leit to him by admirers
or by men to whom he had rendered professional service.

In 44 ne. Cicero boasted8 that he had received more than
¹ 20‚ooo'‚000·sesterces from this source. And one of his ᾖ
legacies, from the philosopher Diodotus⁴ is said to have l
amounted to 1o‚ooo,0oo sesterces, Possibly Cicero received
also a share of the profits which C. Antonius, his colleague
in the consulship, made in his province.⁵ ἶ
