essem, quod iniuria quam accepisti dolore me adfi-
ceret, sapientia tua qua fers iniuriam laetitia, tamen
vidisse te mallem. Nam quod est molestiae, non sane
multo levius est, cum te non viden, quod esse potuit¹
voluptatis certe, si vidissem te, plus fuisset. Itaque
non dubitabo dare operam ut te videam, cum id satis
commode facere potero Interea quod per litteras et
agi tecum et, ut arbitror, confici potest, agam. , Nunc 2
ate illud primum rogabo ne quid invitus mea causa
iacias sed id quod mea intelleges multum, tua nullam
in partem interesse, ita mihi des, si tibi, ut id libenter
facias, ante persuaseris. Cum Patrone Epicurio mihi
omnia sunt, nisi quod in philosophia vehementer ab eo
dissentio. Sed et initio Romae, cum te quoque et tuos
omnes observabat, me coluit in primis et nuper, curn

¹ letter may be compared with the
one to Lucceius (Ep. xviiii. The
case was beset with difficulties.
Memmius had been banished, un-
justly as he thought, at the mo-
ment when he was suing for the
consulship. He was now passing
a disappointed life in exile, and
was sofar estranged from Cicero
that he had gone to Mytilene to
avoid him. He had been annoyed
by the importunity of the Epicu-
reans, for whom at the best he had
{ttteatttttttttttusst {Eli
cated to him the de Rerum Natura,
and his selfish nature brooked no
interferenee with his plans. Finally,
Patr0, the leader of the Epicurean
school, was personally distasteful
to him.

Cicero’s itineraryfrom Minturnae
to Athens was as follows: Cumae,
Beneventum, May 11; Venusia,
May 14; Tarentum, May 183 Brun-
disium, May 22 ; Actium, June 14;

Athens, June 25. The longest
stop on the way was a halt of three
weeks at Brundisium.

r. non satis, etc: before Cicero
reached Athens-te . . ‚visurus
essem: Memmius had withdrawn
to Mitylene, to avoid meeting Cic·
ero (Art. 5. 11. 6), because the
latter had been unwilling to de·
send him against the charge of
ambitus. — iniuria : although the
banishment of Memmius was de
served, technieally it was iniuria,
because, as Memmius had turned
state's evidence, and had brought
a charge of ambitus against Cn.
Domitius Calvinus (Q. fr. 3. 2. 3),
he might have reasonably expected
exemption from punishment.

2. curn Patrone . . . sunt,
Patro and l are quite devoted to
one another. Patro was at the
head ol the Epicurean school in
Athens. Cicero was an adherent
of the Academy, and had little in
common with the Epicuream,-
