lxxiv INTRODUCTION.

’ characteristics of colloquial language is its fondness lor the
picturesque. This is secured mainly by the use ol meta· ³
phors. One of the commonest figures employed in the ,
Letters is that drawn from heat and oold,-the former l
indicating activity‚ the latter inertia: eg. illi rumores dr
comitiis Transpadanorum Cumarum tenus caluerunt (Cael.,
Fam. 8. 1. 2); cum Romae a iudiciis farum refrixerit (Aa. l
1. 1. 2); scripsi Curionem ualde frigere, iam calet (Cael., l
Fam. 8. 6. 5). Commercial‚ legal, and popular expressions,
in a figurative sense, also occur in great variety. Cf. also
notes to quas ego pugnas et'quanias strages edidi, Epist. V. 1,
and-medicinam, Epist. IX. 2. · ³

100. Polite Plirases. Such polite phrases assi meamus
(eg. Vatin, Fam, 5. 9. 1), amabo ie (eg. Cael, Fam. 8. 6. 5),

. and such terms of endearment as malac deliciae tuae (Cael., .
Fam. 8. 8. 1), are naturally of frequent occurrence. Appar-

·ently‘the Plautine sis '(si vis) and sodes are not used. Cl.
also notes to nostri amares, Epist.VII. 2, si me amas, Epist.
XIII. 3, and molestum, Epist. XVIII. 10.

101. Pleanasm. While aiming at brevity in some cases,
in others familiar speech indulges itseli in duplicative or
pleonastic expressions for the sake of emphasis or distinct· ἢ
ῃεεε, in much the same way as it employs extravagant
language. Instances from the Letters are rursus reducere l
(Balbus, Ati. 8. 15a. 1); malle potius (Cat0‚ Fam. 15. 5. 2); ,
nostro iudicio . . . existimamus (Balbus and Oppius, Ati.
9. 7a. 1), ostentare crebro (Dolabella, Fam. 9. 9. 2). On .
‘double expressions‚’ cl. note to oro obsecro, Epist. L. 1.
See also §79

102. Papularand Proverbial Expressians. The intormal
character of the Letters is shown, not so much by the Ire
quent use of these expressions, although their number in
the aggregate is large, as by the lact that they are unac-
companied by any such apologetic phrase as ut aiunt,
