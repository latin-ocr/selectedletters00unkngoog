added to substantiveS, to adjectives, to adverbS, and even
to the comparative form oi the adjective and adverb, and

Cf. note to pulchellus, Epist. V. ro.

77. Words compauuded milla per- and sun. Equally com·
mon is the use with adjectives, adverbs, and verbs oi the pre
fixes per· and suh, which respectively strengthen and wealren
the force oi the words to which they are attached ; eg. per-
benevolus (Fam. 14. 4. 6), subirascor, ‘I am a trifle pro
voked' (Aa. 9. 7. 7). The use oi these prefixes is not by
any means unknown in formal literature, but in epistolary
Latin it gives rise to many new and strange compounds, eg.
pervesperi (Fam. 9. 2. 1), suliuuuis (Au. 2. 17. 2), and suh
lurpr'culus (Art. 4. 5. r). lt is in the ireedom with which
such compounds were formed, and the frequency with which ,
they were used, that colloquial Latin was distinguished from
formal Latin. These compounds had gone so iar toward
supplanting the simple words in familiar speech that in
some cases they differed in no wise from them, as is shown
in the phrase quae parcius frater perscrpseral (Q. Cic, Fau.
16. 27. 1). C .also note to pertumultuose, Epist. XXXIV. 3.

78. Verls campauuded willa ad-, oon. etc. In this connec-
tion mention maybe made oi verbscompoundedwith ad-,cou-,
de, and dis, which are used in the Letters not only with great ³
frequency, but often when they do not apparently differ in

⁰ meaning from the simple verbs. Compounds with clu· are
, especially noteworthy. Cf. note to dirrupit), Epist. XLVIII. 2. ἵ

79. Frequeulatives. F requentatives are used with such
freedom, and so often in the double iorm (eg. uertite, >
Matius, Fam. 11. 28. 7), or with the addition of such words
as saepe or erebra, as, ior instance, ostentare crebro solebat ,
(Dolabella, Fam. 9. 9. 2), that one is at first inclined to 3
think that the frequentative has lost its characteristic force
in such cases3 but it is more probable that in the double
