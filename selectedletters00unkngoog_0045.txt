40. He found matters however in a far less lavorable
condition than he had hoped to find thern, and absented
himself from the meeting ol the senate, Sept. 1, on the plea
of illness. Antony was angry at Cicero’s absence and
threatened to tear his house down.¹ On the following day
Cicero appeared in the senate and delivered his first
Philippic.² It was an outspoken criticism of Antony's
action, but was free from personality. On Sept. 19 Antony
made a violent reply to Cicero’s criticism.³

The province ol Macedonia had at first been assigned
to Antony for the year 43,⁴ but in June, in spite of the oppo
sition of the senate, he secured the passage of a bill in the
comitia assigning to him Gallia Cisalpina, with Gallia Trans
alpina perhaps, in place ol Macedonia.⁶ He doubtless pre-
ferred Gallia Cisalpina, as it would enable him to remain
nearer Rome and because it was the key to ltaly.⁶ He
left the city Nov. 28, hastening toward the north with three
legions and his body-guard to dispossess D. Brutus,⁷ to
whom Gallia Cisalpina had fallen under the arrangements
oi Caesar.

struggle with Antony begins He saw the weak and the

unerring and his courage unfaltering. He saw that
Octavius must be attached to the senatorial party, and
Octavius was invested with the imperium and authorized,
in cooperation with the consuls ot 43 nc, to conduct the
war against Antony.8 Hc appreciated that at all hazards
