personal victory ior him, but also a political victory ior the
Optimates. Through the favorable action ol the pontifices,
Cicero had recovered his building site on the Palatine and
damages lor the loss of his house and villas. The unani-
mous acquittal, in Mar, 56 ac„ of P. Sestius, Cicero’s
ioremost champion in 57 ac, who was prosecuted ona
charge de ambitu et de ui, was a decided triumph ior Cicero
and the Boni.¹ Furthermore‚ there was a lack of harmony
in the party of the triumvirs. Emboldened by this state oi
things, the senate, on Apr. 5, 56 ac, adopted Cicero's
motion at de agro Campano . Idibus Maiis referretur.²
The law at which this motion to reconsider was directed
was Caesar’s agrarian law oi 59 uc, assigning lands in
Campania to Pompey’s veterans. Success in repealing this
law would also undoubtedly lead to an attack upon all the
legislation oi the year 59 uc.

oi conference with Caesar) discesserat, convenisset, ‘te‚’
inquit, ‘ipsum cupra· nihil opportunius potuit accidere: nisi

milipro illo spopondisti! Quid multat questus est graviter ,·
sua merita commemoravit,· quid egisset saepissime de actis
Caesaris cam ipso meo fratre quidque sibi is de me recepisset, in
maronam redegit seque, quae de mea salute egisset, uoluntate
Caesaris egisse ipsm meam fratrem testatus est: cuius causam
, dignitatemque milei at commendaret, rogavit, ut eam ne oppug-
ἓ, narem, si nollem aut aaa possem tueri. This important
¹ , passage iumishes the explanation of that remarkable change
³ which Cicero’s ''political attitude underwent in 56 ue.
Quintus had promised Pompey that his brother, if recalled,
would not oppose the triumvirs. As a man oi honor,
