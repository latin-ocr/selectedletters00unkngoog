¹7· de statua Africani . . .
Metelli: in his de Re Pub. Cicero
had made Laelius lament the fact
that no statue had been erected
to the memory of Scipio Nasica
Serapion (cf. Macr. Comment. 1.
4). Q. Caecilius Metellus Scipio,
a descendant of Nasica, called the
attention of Atticus to what he
considered Cicero’s error, as he
himself had set up a gilded eques·
trian statue in honor of his ances- ,
tor (cf. quas... posuit), to say
nothing of the ancient statue of
Serapion already standing near the
temple of Ops. But the statue
standing near the temple of Ops
has causon inscribed upon it, and
cannot therefore represent Sera-
pion, who never held that office.
Furthermore, the two ancient
statues, standing ad Opis and
ad Πολυκλέους Herculem, repre·
sent the same person, as a com·
parison of the two shows. Now
the statne ad. . . Herculem is a
likeness of Africanus. Therefore
the other ancient statue (ad Opis)
must represent the same person,

and upon whose base he has put
the name of Serapion, is in reality
a reproduction of an ancient like-
ness of Africanus— d πραγμάτων

Atticus was an enthusiastic stu-
dent of Roman history, of anti·
quities, and of genealogy, and his
interest in these subiects led him
to erect the statue. Cf. Nep.
