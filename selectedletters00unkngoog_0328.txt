Σπουδαῖον οὐδὲν in sermone, φιλόλογα multa. Quid ,
quaeris? Delectatus est et libenter fuit. Puteolis se ’
aiebat unum diem fore, alterum ad Baias. Habes

This military evolution, which con-
sisted in parading on either side
of Caesar, was intended as a corn-
pliment to Dolabella. — Nicia:
a common friend of Cicero and
Dolabella
The excitement which this visit
produced is reflected in the lan-
