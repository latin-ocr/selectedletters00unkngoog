93. Alliteratian. While alliteration is found iu the prose ,
and poetry of all periods‚ it is especially common in ancient
legal and religious formulae and in popular sayings. As ,
the latter appear in large numbers in the more familiar ,
letters, alliteration becomes one oi the stylistic character· ,
istics ol Cicero's correspondence. Cf. cura, cogitatae, . . . ,
commentatio causarum (Fam. 9. 20. 1) 3 epm et alcum (Aa. ἶ
²⁸ 17¹ Ῑ)· l
94. Asyadetan'. In addition to asyndeton for emphasis

and between clauses in lively narration, which is found
in contemporaneous formal literature, Bbclrel¹ calls attention
to two classes of cases in which asyndeton occurs in the
Letters‚ as it does in other colloquial literature, with great
frequency: (1) between two expressions of opposite mean· Ι
ing, eg. palam secreta (Cael, Fam. 8. r. 4), velit nolit (Q.
sr. 3. 8. 4) ; (2) between two expressions oi similar meaning,
eg. zatercedendz' tmpediendi (Fam. 8. 8. 6), certa clara (Aa. 16.
13c. 2). Many ol these expressions, like those discussed
under Alliteratian, are stereotyped popular phrases.
95. Brevity. Brevity is secured iu many cases by the use
of pregnant expressions, aud by the omission oi words and
phrases not absolutely necessary to ¹the sense. The words
most commonly omitted are esse, dicere (many forms of both
words are omitted), fieri, aedes, and the pronoun as an
object or as the subject of an infinitive.
In some instances more uncommon ellipses occur, eg. y
¹ cx Gallia [provincia] Lepidi (Pollio, Fam. 10. 33. 4); laec
magis animadversum est, quad intactus ab sibila pervenerat
' Hortensius ad senectutem,· sedtum tam bene (sibilatus est) at
in totam vitam quoivis satis esset (Cael, Fam. 8. 2. 1). Cf. y
also ξ 7 5, and note to a Vestae, Epist. XIII. 2.
