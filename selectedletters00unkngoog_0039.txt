The Pompeians, atter planning a rendezvous at Luceria,¹
hurried toward Brundisium, whither Pompey peremptorily
summoned Cicero.2 Nevertheless he remained in For-
miae, hoping still to effect a reconciliation between Caesar
and Pompey,³ and, with this hope in mind, he had an
interview with Caesar at F ormiae,⁴ Mar. 28. In this inter-
view Caesar requested him to go to Rome and use his
best efforts to secure peace, but when Cicero mentioned
the terms which he should propose, Caesar refused to
accept them.

30. This meeting-put an end to his hesitation. He lelt
sure that all hope ol a reconciliation was gone, as neither
party would submit terms which the other could accept.
Cicero has been often accused of indecision during this
period, but unjustly s0. In his opinion there was right and
wrong with each party, and civil war was an evil to be
avoided at all hazards He used every possible means,
therefore, to avert the catastrophe, but without success.
Recognizing the inevitable, he cast in his lot with theman
to whom he personally owed most3 ior the choice lay, not
between Caesar and the Republic, but between Caesar and
Pompey; nec mehercule hoc socio reipublicae causo, quam
funditus deletam puto, sed ne quis me putet ingratum in eum
qui me levavit iis incommodas (ie. of exile) quibus rilem
arisereratffltt. 9. 19. a). ν
