2. qui nunc petunt, who are
candidates tlzis year- Caesar:
L. Julius Caesar, uncle of An·
tony the triumvir, and, by the
second marriage of his sister
Juha, brother-Inlaw of Lentulus,
the Catilinarian conspirator. He
tried unsuccessfully to mediate ln
43 Bc. between the senate and
Antony (Phil. 8. ι). He was
placed by Antony upon the list of
the proscribed in return for the
consent of Octavius to the murder
of Cicero, and escaped death only
through the devotion of his sister
lulla. —certus: here* sure to win.'
ThIs expectation was realized.—
Thermus cum Silano: the con·
suls for 64 rac. (cf. Ep. II.) were
I.. Julius Caesar and C. Marcius
Figidus, so that either another
candidate than the three mentioned
here came to the front and was
elected, or else Thermus became
Figulus by adoption and held the
office under that name. It was
D. Junius Silanus who, as consul
designabis, and therefore first
speaker in the senate, proposed
that lentulus and his fellowcon-

spirators should be put to death
(Cat. 4. 7).-'l‘hermus ex-
istimatur: i.e. it is expected that
there will be a hard fight between
Thermus and Silanus—ab ami·
cis : ab is not infrequently used to
introduce a limitatIon with adjec-
tives which signify power, equip
ment, or their opposites, ag. ab
equitatufirmus, Ep. XCVIII. 2; ab
amni re sumus paratiores, Fam. 10.
8. 6, and elsewhere. — Curium ob·
ducere: tle. to run Curius in oppo-
sition. Curius, evidently a man
held in light esteem, may have
been the Quintus Curius who in·
formed Cicero of Catiline's plans.
-Thermum fieri: sc. consulem.
-si in nostrum annum recide-
rit, if lte gari over to my year,
ir. to the election for 63 nc.
—viae Flamtniae: the great
northern thoroughfare from Rome
to the Adriatic. The completion
(absoluta) of this road would, as
CIcero thinks, give Thermus po-
litical prestige and influence, and
therefore make him a dangerous
opponent a year laten-although at
the time of writing he has few
followers (inopes ab amicis).
⁴⁶ The great Roman roads, such as
the via Appia, Flamima, etc, were
called viae praetoriae or consula·
