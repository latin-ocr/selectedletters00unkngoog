lvi IN TRODUCTION.

64. Letters were often written by secretaries from dicta·
tion, but most ol Cicero’s letters to Atticus and Quintus
at least were written with his own hand3 ior in 59 uc. he
writes to Atticus: numquam autc arbitror te epistulam meam
legisse, uisi mea mauu scriptam& and in 49 uc: lippitudinis
meae siguum tibi sit librari mauus²,· and in 54 uc. to
Quintus: scribis cuim te meas litteras superiores clx legere
potuisse, iu quo nihil eorum, mi frater, fuit quae putus,· neque
enim occupatus eram neque perturbatus uec iratus alicui, sel
lior facio semper ut, quicunque colamus in marcus meas uenerit,
co sie utar tamquam bauo.8 During the latter part of his
life, however, especially during the years 44 and 43 ae,
even the letters to Atticus were written by a secretaryf
Cicero’s principal secretary was Tiro. Mention is'also made
ol another, Spintharus by name?

As there was no postal system at that time, letters had to
be sent by one’s own messengers (tabellarii) or the messen-
gers of one's friends This made the composition oi a letter
a more serious matter in Cicero's day than it is in ours.
But his letters were not always studied productioris: some
of them were written while he was traveling3 others between
the courses at dinner⁰; and he writes to Cassiusl: praeposteros
babes tabellarias . . . cum a mc discedunt, flagitant litteras . . .
atquc icl ipsum facerent commodius, si mibi aliquid spati al
scribendum clareat, secl petasati ueniunt, comites aa' portam
exspectare dicunt.

Some idea oi the speedt with which letters were carried

may be gathered from the following instances: letters arrived l

at Rome from Brundisium on the sixth tday, irom Sicily on
