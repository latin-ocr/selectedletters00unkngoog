position in Egypt1 made it quite possible that the Pompeian
cause might succeed after all, in which case Cicero's standing
would be still more precarious. His family affairs were
equally distressing: Tullia, his daughter, was most unhappy

somewhat relieved in Sept, 47 ac, by the arrival of Caesar,
who generously gave him permission to remain in Italy.⁴
He went almost directly to Rome, and his letters in the
main, up to the close of 46 rac, were written either in that
city or at his villas at Tusculum and Cumae. The battle
of Thapsus was fought Apr. 6, 46 ac„ and by it Caesar’s
supremacy in Africa was established3 but the tidings

that Cato had taken his own life at Utica! feeling that the
cause of the Republic was beyond hope. The little memoir

called forth opposition pamphlets from the Caesarians,
Hirtius⁹ and Brutus‚¹⁰ and even Caesar found time on the
eve of the battle of Munda to write an ‘Anticata’ ¹¹

period. The Orator was written and the Brutus finished in
