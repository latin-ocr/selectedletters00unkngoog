Meanwhile, in the north, Antony was strengthened by the
accession ol Lepidus,l Plancus, and ΡοΠίο.2 D. Brutus
was deserted by his troops, and while seeking to escape was
murdered at Aquileia.8 ’

43. In the East the cause of the liberatores‘had been
more successful. In the early part of 43 nc. M. Brutus
reached the province of Macedonia, which had been assigned
to him by Caesar, and was recognized as the legal governor
by his predecessor Q. Hortensius.⁴ Cassius also took pos-
session of his province, Syria. Both ol them succeeded in
levying large bodies of troops and in defeating C. Antonius,⁵
the brother of Marcus, and Dolabella,⁰ who had come out to
take possessionof Macedonia and Syria respectively, by
virtue of measures whose passage Antony had secured.
The senatorial party was in the meantime urging Brutus
and Cassius to retum and protect Italy from the troops of
Antony! Cicero also wrote to both leaders, asking them to
adopt this coursc,⁸ but their entreaties were without effect.

44. In Italy matters were rapidly advancing to a crisis.
Octavius, soon aiter his elevation t0 the consulship, marched
northward, met Antony near Bononia in Oct, 43 rae, and
with M. Lepidus formed a compact for the adjustment of
affairs in Italy and ior the prosecution of the war in the
East against the lz'beratores⁹; and in November, bya vote of ‘
the comitia, Antony, Lepidus, and Octavius were appointed
commissioners ‘for the reorganization of the state' for a
period of five years¹⁰
