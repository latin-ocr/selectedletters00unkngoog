1001 01 adiungit classem et exercitum et maius imperium
in provinciis quam sit eorum qui eas obtineant. llla
nostra lex consularis nunc modesta videtur, haec Messi ’
000 ferenda. Pompeius illam velle sedicit, familiares
hanc. Consulares duce Favonio fremunt; nos tacemus
et eo magis, quod de domo nostra nihil adhuc pontifi-
ces responderunt. Qui si sustulerint religionem, aream
praeclaram habebimus, superficiem consules ex sena·
tus consulto aestimabunt; sin aliter, demolientur, suo ¹
nomine locabunt‚ rem totam aestimabunt. Ita sunt res 8
nostrae, ‘ut in secundis fluxae, ut in adversis bonae'
In re familiari valde sumus, ut scis, perturbati. Prae-

- Pompeius . . . hanc: a good
illustration 01 Pompey's political
methods.—Favonio: a man of
more energy than tact; an admirer
and imitator 01 Cato. Although
only a quaestor, the boldness with
which he advocated the cause 01
1110 Optimates brought even the
consulares to accept him as their
leader. He was praetor when the
Civil War opened, took Pompey's
side, and was pardoned by Caesar
after the battle of Pharsalus. He
fought on the side 01 1110 libera-

was put to death after the battle

ero’s letters to the trouble between
himself and Terentia, which led

rentia’s name here is very signifi-
