*Trebonio ; C. Trebonius was
rewarded t'or the services which he
rendered to Caesar during his tri-
bunate by being appointed as Cae-
sar's legate in Gaul, where he was

Caesar’s influence propraetor of
Spain. He, however, joined the
conspirators against Caesar's life
in 44 rac. He was murdered in
Syria in the same year by Dola-
bella, being thus the first one of
the liberatores to suffer for his
connection with that plot- Fa-
bium: another oi Caesar's legates
in Gaul. The reports that he had
deserted, and that Trebonius had
been defeated, were without foun-

the most trusted and skilt'ul of
Caesar’s lieutenants, gave the
Pompeians great hopes of further
defections from Caesar‘s forces,
and the air was full of rumors ol
such desertions.—magnis copiis:
