No one could have been more unlilre Cicero than his
only son Marcus, and it would be humorouS‚ if it were not
pathetic, to see the orator hopefully instructing the would-be ι
soldier in the mysteries of philosophy and law. But when
the boy had taken up the profession of arms under Brutus,
and thus brought to naught the father’s hope that his son
would succeed him at the bar and in the senate, Cicero
gracefully accepted the inevitable. He ⁸followed his son's
movements with the liveliest interest, aud heard with pater·
nal pride the reports of his prowess.

To his brother Quintus, Cicero was always loyal 3ηά
devoted'. Their friendly relations were broken but onee‚¹
3ηά then only for abrief period. They were men of very
different temperamenta Marcus acted in general with
deliberation3 sometimes in fact, he hesitated too long.
Quintus was nervous and impulsive.

One dwells‚ however, with most pleasure upon Cicero’s
treatment of his personal dependente Not only his favoritc
freedman Tiro, but the very slaves of his household enjoyed
his kindness and generosity.

50. This sympathetic sensitiveness in Cicero’s nature
gives to his character its special charm, and constitutos at
the same time its principal weakness Those moments of
exaltation and of depression, those periods when he help
lessly fluctuates between different courses of action‚¹ find
their explanation in this quality. His humor is determined
by the circumstances of the moment. He looks therefore,
the calm poise of the less impressionable nature. He fails³
to give things their proper proportions‚ and consequently
his forecasts of the future are generally either too sanguine
or too gloomy. It was this quality, of course, which made
him au opportunist in politics
