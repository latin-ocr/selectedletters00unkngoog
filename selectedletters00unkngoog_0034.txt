xxviii INTRODUCTION.

and the time seemed to Pompey ripe for strengthening him·
seli and humbling his rival. He was practically dictator in
Rome, and still retained his govemorship of Spain, while ‘
his rival, Caesar, was far away in Gaul, engaged with Ver· l
cingetorix, his bravest and ablest enemy, in a life and death
struggle,¹ which might end with him as the Parthian cam· '
paign had ended with Crassus.
After assuming office Pompey secured the passage of l
laws imposing heavier penalties for bribery and violence,2 Ι
Ι prolonging his proconsulship os Spain for five yearS,³ and
a law de iure magistratuum,⁴ providing that candidates for ἓ
office must appear in person a certain number of days before
the electiori, and that those who had held >office in Rome
must wait five years before assuming the government of a
province. Caesar was, however, exempted from the opera-
tion of the first clause of this law by a special measure‚⁵and
also by a provision unconstitutionally appended to the law
itself as an afterthought by Pompey.⁶ The second provision
in the law was, however, intended to bring Caesar low. Even
ifhe should succeed in securing an election to the consul-
ship, it would be easy, after his term of office had expired,
,to prosecute him and to convict him of using violence in
his candidacy for the consulship in 60 ac, under the new
law dcvi, which was retroactive.
