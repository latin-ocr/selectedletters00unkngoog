expressed‚ but in the form in which it found expression.

Satires, and of Petronius, will find, as might be expected,
many poInts of contact between the language of these writers
and the language of the Letters, with such differeuces in gen-
eral as result from the influences just noted. Itis interest·
ing also to observe that many stylistic peculiarities which

in the Letters is the diminutive. The diminutive ending is
